bromwell high is a cartoon comedy it ran at the same time as some other programs about school life such as teachers my 35 years in the teaching profession lead me to believe that bromwell high's satire is much closer to reality than is teachers the scramble to survive financially the insightful students who can see right through their pathetic teachers pomp the pettiness of the whole situation all remind me of the schools i knew and their students when i saw the episode in which a student repeatedly tried to burn down the school i immediately recalled at high a classic line inspector i'm here to sack one of your teachers student welcome to bromwell high i expect that many adults of my age think that bromwell high is far fetched what a pity that it isn't 
homelessness or houselessness as george carlin stated has been an issue for years but never a plan to help those on the street that were once considered human who did everything from going to school work or vote for the matter most people think of the homeless as just a lost cause while worrying about things such as racism the war on iraq pressuring kids to succeed technology the elections inflation or worrying if they'll be next to end up on the streets br br but what if you were given a bet to live on the streets for a month without the luxuries you once had from a home the entertainment sets a bathroom pictures on the wall a computer and everything you once treasure to see what it's like to be homeless that is goddard bolt's lesson br br mel brooks who directs who stars as bolt plays a rich man who has everything in the world until deciding to make a bet with a sissy rival jeffery tambor to see if he can live in the streets for thirty days without the luxuries if bolt succeeds he can do what he wants with a future project of making more buildings the bet's on where bolt is thrown on the street with a bracelet on his leg to monitor his every move where he can't step off the sidewalk he's given the nickname pepto by a vagrant after it's written on his forehead where bolt meets other characters including a woman by the name of molly lesley ann warren an ex-dancer who got divorce before losing her home and her pals sailor howard morris and fumes teddy wilson who are already used to the streets they're survivors bolt isn't he's not used to reaching mutual agreements like he once did when being rich where it's fight or flight kill or be killed br br while the love connection between molly and bolt wasn't necessary to plot i found life stinks to be one of mel brooks observant films where prior to being a comedy it shows a tender side compared to his slapstick work such as blazing saddles young frankenstein or spaceballs for the matter to show what it's like having something valuable before losing it the next day or on the other hand making a stupid bet like all rich people do when they don't know what to do with their money maybe they should give it to the homeless instead of using it like monopoly money br br or maybe this film will inspire you to help others 
brilliant over-acting by lesley ann warren best dramatic hobo lady i have ever seen and love scenes in clothes warehouse are second to none the corn on face is a classic as good as anything in blazing saddles the take on lawyers is also superb after being accused of being a turncoat selling out his boss and being dishonest the lawyer of pepto bolt shrugs indifferently i'm a lawyer he says three funny words jeffrey tambor a favorite from the later larry sanders show is fantastic here too as a mad millionaire who wants to crush the ghetto his character is more malevolent than usual the hospital scene and the scene where the homeless invade a demolition site are all-time classics look for the legs scene and the two big diggers fighting one bleeds this movie gets better each time i see it which is quite often 
this is easily the most underrated film inn the brooks cannon sure its flawed it does not give a realistic view of homelessness unlike say how citizen kane gave a realistic view of lounge singers or titanic gave a realistic view of italians you idiots many of the jokes fall flat but still this film is very lovable in a way many comedies are not and to pull that off in a story about some of the most traditionally reviled members of society is truly impressive its not the fisher king but its not crap either my only complaint is that brooks should have cast someone else in the lead i love mel as a director and writer not so much as a lead 
this is not the typical mel brooks film it was much less slapstick than most of his movies and actually had a plot that was followable leslie ann warren made the movie she is such a fantastic under-rated actress there were some moments that could have been fleshed out a bit more and some scenes that could probably have been cut to make the room to do so but all in all this is worth the price to rent and see it the acting was good overall brooks himself did a good job without his characteristic speaking to directly to the audience again warren was the best actor in the movie but fume and sailor both played their parts well 
this isn't the comedic robin williams nor is it the quirky insane robin williams of recent thriller fame this is a hybrid of the classic drama without over-dramatization mixed with robin's new love of the thriller but this isn't a thriller per se this is more a mystery suspense vehicle through which williams attempts to locate a sick boy and his keeper br br also starring sandra oh and rory culkin this suspense drama plays pretty much like a news report until william's character gets close to achieving his goal br br i must say that i was highly entertained though this movie fails to teach guide inspect or amuse it felt more like i was watching a guy williams as he was actually performing the actions from a third person perspective in other words it felt real and i was able to subscribe to the premise of the story br br all in all it's worth a watch though it's definitely not friday saturday night fare br br it rates a 7 7 10 from br br the fiend 
yes its an art to successfully make a slow paced thriller br br the story unfolds in nice volumes while you don't even notice it happening br br fine performance by robin williams the sexuality angles in the film can seem unnecessary and can probably affect how much you enjoy the film however the core plot is very engaging the movie doesn't rush onto you and still grips you enough to keep you wondering the direction is good use of lights to achieve desired affects of suspense and unexpectedness is good br br very nice 1 time watch if you are looking to lay back and hear a thrilling short story 
in this critically acclaimed psychological thriller based on true events gabriel robin williams a celebrated writer and late-night talk show host becomes captivated by the harrowing story of a young listener and his adoptive mother toni collette when troubling questions arise about this boy's story however gabriel finds himself drawn into a widening mystery that hides a deadly secret according to film's official synopsis br br you really should stop reading these comments and watch the film now br br the how did he lose his leg ending with ms collette planning her new life should be chopped off and sent to deleted scenes land it's overkill the true nature of her physical and mental ailments should be obvious by the time mr williams returns to new york possibly her blindness could be in question but a revelation could have be made certain in either the highway or video tape scenes the film would benefit from a re-editing how about a director's cut br br williams and bobby cannavale as jess don't seem initially believable as a couple a scene or two establishing their relationship might have helped set the stage otherwise the cast is exemplary williams offers an exceptionally strong characterization and not a gay impersonation sandra oh as anna joe morton as ashe and rory culkin pete logand are all perfect br br best of all collette's donna belongs in the creepy hall of fame ms oh is correct in saying collette might be you know like that guy from psycho there have been several years when organizations giving acting awards seemed to reach for women due to a slighter dispersion of roles certainly they could have noticed collette with some award consideration she is that good and director patrick stettner definitely evokes hitchcock he even makes getting a sandwich from a vending machine suspenseful br br finally writers stettner armistead maupin and terry anderson deserve gratitude from flight attendants everywhere br br the night listener 1 21 06 patrick stettner robin williams toni collette sandra oh rory culkin 
the night listener 2006 1 2 robin williams toni collette bobby cannavale rory culkin joe morton sandra oh john cullum lisa emery becky ann baker dir patrick stettner br br hitchcockian suspenser gives williams a stand-out low-key performance br br what is it about celebrities and fans what is the near paranoia one associates with the other and why is it almost the norm br br in the latest derange fan scenario based on true events no less williams stars as a talk-radio personality named gabriel no one who reads stories he's penned over the airwaves and has accumulated an interesting fan in the form of a young boy named pete logand culkin who has submitted a manuscript about the travails of his troubled youth to no one's editor ashe morton who gives it to no one to read for himself br br no one is naturally disturbed but ultimately intrigued about the nightmarish existence of pete being abducted and sexually abused for years until he was finally rescued by a nurse named donna collette giving an excellent performance who has adopted the boy but her correspondence with no one reveals that pete is dying from aids naturally no one wants to meet the fans but is suddenly in doubt to their possibly devious ulterior motives when the seed is planted by his estranged lover jess cannavale whose sudden departure from their new york city apartment has no one in an emotional tailspin that has only now grown into a tempest in a teacup when he decides to do some investigating into donna and pete's backgrounds discovering some truths that he didn't anticipate br br written by armistead maupin who co-wrote the screenplay with his former lover terry anderson and the film's novice director stettner and based on a true story about a fan's hoax found out has some hitchcockian moments that run on full tilt like any good old fashioned pot-boiler does it helps that williams gives a stand-out low-key performance as the conflicted good-hearted personality who genuinely wants to believe that his number one fan is in fact real and does love him the one thing that has escaped his own reality and has some unsettling dreadful moments with the creepy collette whose one physical trait i will leave unmentioned but underlines the desperation of her character that can rattle you to the core br br however the film runs out of gas and eventually becomes a bit repetitive and predictable despite a finely directed piece of hoodwink and mystery by stettner it pays to listen to your own inner voice be careful of what you hope for 
you know robin williams god bless him is constantly shooting himself in the foot lately with all these dumb comedies he has done this decade with perhaps the exception of death to smoochy which bombed when it came out but is now a cult classic the dramas he has made lately have been fantastic especially insomnia and one hour photo the night listener despite mediocre reviews and a quick dvd release is among his best work period br br this is a very chilling story even though it doesn't include a serial killer or anyone that physically dangerous for that matter the concept of the film is based on an actual case of fraud that still has yet to be officially confirmed in high school i read an autobiography by a child named anthony godby johnson who suffered horrific abuse and eventually contracted aids as a result i was moved by the story until i read reports online that johnson may not actually exist when i saw this movie the confused feelings that robin williams so brilliantly portrayed resurfaced in my mind br br toni collette probably gives her best dramatic performance too as the ultimately sociopathic caretaker her role was a far cry from those she had in movies like little miss sunshine there were even times she looked into the camera where i thought she was staring right at me it takes a good actress to play that sort of role and it's this understated yet well reviewed role that makes toni collette probably one of the best actresses of this generation not to have even been nominated for an academy award as of 2008 it's incredible that there is at least one woman in this world who is like this and it's scary too br br this is a good dark film that i highly recommend be prepared to be unsettled though because this movie leaves you with a strange feeling at the end 
when i first read armistead maupins story i was taken in by the human drama displayed by gabriel no one and those he cares about and loves that being said we have now been given the film version of an excellent story and are expected to see past the gloss of hollywood br br writer armistead maupin and director patrick stettner have truly succeeded br br with just the right amount of restraint robin williams captures the fragile essence of gabriel and lets us see his struggle with issues of trust both in his personnel life jess and the world around him donna br br as we are introduced to the players in this drama we are reminded that nothing is ever as it seems and that the smallest event can change our lives irrevocably the request to review a book written by a young man turns into a life changing event that helps gabriel find the strength within himself to carry on and move forward br br it's to bad that most people will avoid this film i only say that because the average american will probably think robin williams in a serious role that didn't work before please give this movie a chance robin williams touches the darkness we all must find and go through in ourselves to be better people like his movie one hour photo he has stepped up as an actor and made another quality piece of art br br oh and before i forget i believe bobby cannavale as jess steals every scene he is in he has the 1940's leading man looks and screen presence it's this hacks opinion he could carry his own movie right now br br s 
i liked the film some of the action scenes were very interesting tense and well done i especially liked the opening scene which had a semi truck in it a very tense action scene that seemed well done br br some of the transitional scenes were filmed in interesting ways such as time lapse photography unusual colors or interesting angles also the film is funny is several parts i also liked how the evil guy was portrayed too i'd give the film an 8 out of 10 
there are many illnesses born in the mind of man which have been given life in modern times constant vigilance or accrued information in the realm of pyschosis have kept psychologists counselors and psychiatrists busy with enough work to last them decades occasionally some of these mental phenomenon are discover by those with no knowledge of their remedy or even of their existence that is the premise of the film entitled the night listner it tells the story of a popular radio host called gabriel noon robin williams who spends his evenings enthralling his audiences with vivid stories about gay lifestyles perhaps its because his show is losing it's authentic veneer which causes noon to admit he is no longer himself feeling abandoned by both his lover jess bobby cannavale and his and best friend joe morton he seeks shelter in his deepening despair and isolation it is here a mysterious voice in the night asks him for help noon needs to feel useful and reaches out to the desperate voice which belongs to a 14 year old boy called peter rory culkin in reading the boy's harrowing manuscript which depicts the early life and sexual abuse at the hands of his brutal parents noon is captivated and wants to help however things are not what they seem and noon soon finds himself en-wrapped in an elusive and bizarre tale torn right out of a medical nightmare this movie is pure robin williams and were it not for toni collette who plays donna d logand sandra oh as anna and john cullum as pop this might be comical instead this may prove to be one of william's more serious performances 
i enjoyed the night listener very much it's one of the better movies of the summer br br robin williams gives one of his best performances in fact the entire cast was very good all played just the right notes for their characters not too much and not too little sandra oh adds a wonderful comic touch toni collette is great as the mom and never goes over the top everyone is very believable br br it's a short movie just under an hour and a half i noticed the general release version is nine minutes shorter than the sundance version i wonder if some of the more disturbing images were cut from the movie br br the director told a story and did it in straightforward fashion which is a refreshing change from many directors these days who seem to think their job is to impress the audience rather than tell a story and tell it well br br do not be sucker punched by the previews and ads it is not a hitchcockian thriller see the night listener because you want to see a good story told well if you go expecting hitchcock you will be disappointed br br my only complaint with the movie was the ending the director could have left a little more to the audience's imagination but this is a minor quibble 
the night listener is probably not one of william's best roles but he makes a very interesting character in a somewhat odd but very different movie i can guarantee you that you have never seen this kind of movie before some people maybe won't like the slow pacing of this movie but i think it's the great plus of the movie it is definitely one of the top movies that have come out the year 2006 it has a intriguing performance in a movie with a great content dramatic feeling this is no americanized movie neither is it a predictable movie you just feel that it is a movie that has secrets which you have a hard time to determine what the outcome of it may be this is no excellent movie that has everything but hell it's a damn good and very original movie 
like one of the previous commenters said this had the foundations of a great movie but something happened on the way to delivery such a waste because collette's performance was eerie and williams was believable i just kept waiting for it to get better i don't think it was bad editing or needed another director it could have just been the film it came across as a canadian movie something like the first few seasons of x-files not cheap just hokey also it needed a little more suspense something that makes you jump off your seat the movie reached that moment then faded away kind of like a false climax i can see how being too suspenseful would have taken away from the reality of the story but i thought that part was reached when gabriel was in the hospital looking for the boy this movie needs to have a director's cut that tries to fix these problems 
the night listener held my attention with robin williams shining as a new york city radio host who becomes enamored with his friendship with a 14 year old boy rory culkin who is very ill williams has never met the boy in person as they have only been in contact by talking on the telephone however williams ex-boyfriend nice job from bobby cannavale raises doubt about the boy which prompts williams to arrange a meeting with him in person what follows makes a permanent impact on williams in a way he does not expect i will leave it at that toni collette also stars br br i enjoyed this film with toni collette giving a memorable portrayal of culkin's adoptive mother sandra oh also starred as williams friend the night listener is inspired by actual events and it has a somber almost creepy silence throughout at times it is predictable no thanks to some of the reviews i read before seeing the movie and just due to logic but i liked it anyway i enjoy williams in roles like this more so than his comedic characters so that was an added bonus for me recommended 8 10 
popular radio storyteller gabriel no one robin williams scraggy and speaking in hushed hypnotic tones becomes acquainted and friends with a fourteen-year old boy from wisconsin named pete logand rory culkin who has written a book detailing sexual abuse from his parents to boot pete has aids and this compels gabriel further still since his partner jess bobby cannavale good happens to be a survivor of hiv himself br br he also acquaints himself with pete's guardian a woman named donna toni collette brilliant and when gabriel decides he wants to meet and talk to the two of them in person and goes to wisconsin he discovers some secrets he was naturally not prepared to find br br based on real events that happened to armistead maupin who co-wrote the screenplay with terry anderson and directed by patrick stetner this film moves a lot faster 90 min maybe a few minutes longer than one might think a movie of this genre would run that's good in that it keeps the action and storyline lean and clear it's bad in that it leaves various holes in the plot and doesn't sew-up any of the plot openings or back-story i'd rather not go into any great detail except to say that if you are not familiar with mr maupin's works or his personal story you feel a little bit out of the loop here still the performances by williams i would've loved to heard more of his narration personally collette cannavale culkin and much of the supporting cast the waitress at the restaurant collete's donna frequents does a great job with what small part she has are top-notch and the mood established here namely the chilly lonely dark exteriors of wisconsin and new york give a terrific framing for this story it may have ends that don't tie together particularly well but it's still a compelling enough story to stick with 
if there is one thing to recommend about this film is that it is intriguing the premise certainly draws the audience in because it is a mystery and throughout the film there are hints that there is something dark lurking about however there is not much tension and williams mild mannered portrayal doesn't do much to makes us relate to his obsession with the boy br br collete fares much better as the woman whose true nature and intentions are not very clear the production felt rushed and holes are apparent it certainly feels like a preview for a much more complete and better effort the book is probably better br br one thing is certain taupin must have written something truly good to have inspired at least one commendable effort 
i absolutely loved this film i do not at all relate to all the other comments i have read about it i was completely enthralled through every second br br i found the story gripping the acting intense and the direction spot-on i would literally jump every time the phone would ring close to the end of the movie even though there was nothing scary about the story itself i was soundly on edge through the whole movie and for the rest of my evening br br i found that there were so many perfect choices made the casting the script the little bits of humor sprinkled in it there were so many points where the film could've gone for the cheap thrill but it never did and that for me put this movie above so many of the mediocre thrillers that have come out lately and for the last number of years 
this night listener is better than people are generally saying it has weaknesses and it seems to be having a genre identity crisis no doubt but i think its creepy atmosphere and intriguing performances make up for this the whole thing feels like one of those fireside this happened to a friend of a friend of mine ghost stories one big complaint about the movie is the pacing but the slow and sometimes awkward pacing is deliberate everything that unfolds in this movie is kept well within the realm of possibility and real life just sort of plods along no so there are no flashy endings or earth-shattering revelations no showdown scenes thank heaven you have to get into the zone when watching this movie forget your reservations and your expectations of what makes a conventionally good movie williams isn't terrific but he easily meets the needs of the story plus his character is supposed to be somewhat generic no one as he is the everyman the avatar by which we ourselves enter the story toni collette's performance should be nominated for an oscar even if she maybe shouldn't win it give it a shot for quality and content alone the night listener is surely in the top twenty percent of movies coming out these days 
when it comes to movies i can be pretty picky and i'll complain about anything and everything that is done wrong while every movie has its flaws the night listener had an exceptionally low count br br if you read the last review it was hard since half of it was written in caps and it contained no actual information about the movie you may have been led to believe that this movie was not too well done unfortunately if you read more than 3 lines into that same review you discovered the poster's reason for disdain he she does not like the fact that the director is gay or that the production team smokes crack apparently br br so despite the fact that i have never written a review before i thought this movie deserved one based on its merits not the sexual orientation of its director let's go over a quick checklist first 1 great plot absolutely i won't give a shred of it away but the plot is highly compelling and definitely not what one would expect based on the commercials this is a thriller not a horror and it should be approached as such the story really will amaze you even more so because it's true and the plot did stay quite faithful to the actual events br br 2 wonderful acting oh yes robin williams long ago broke free from the chains of the comedy type-cast and he has since flourished in serious roles for which many people would have wrote him off just a decade ago he once again achieves high form in his role in the night listener playing a radio host who becomes increasingly troubled by and entangled in a case of well i'll let you see for yourself br br 3 excellent direction certainly now unlike the other poster to which i referred i actually know something about direction i've been sutdying the art of direction at school now for 3 years of course i really don't think that makes a lick of difference the only thing that matters is if you like the direction but i thought i should simply establish once again that i'm basing my opinions here on something both substantial and relevant for example not the sexual orientation of the director or the alleged drug habits of the production team lol br br patrick stettner's direction was moody and dark and he allowed the angles and lighting to help create those so-sought after feelings of tension and release rather than the messy fast-paced camera-work and quick cuts we're so often subjected to today some people can truly show you a story through their camera while other's feel as if they have to make the story with the camera i really appreciate when someone these days has the courage to just use the camera as its supposed to be utilized which is as an eyeball through which we all see br br 4 lighting cinematography and editing great all around i've already wrote so much and i could go on about these last three things for another ten paragraphs so i'll just wrap it up br br in short go see this movie don't listen to people who have alterior motives for trashing it especially if they're so stupid that they unknowingly reveal that motive 1 4 of the way through their post enjoy the show ben 
somewhat funny and well-paced action thriller that has jamie foxx as a hapless fast-talking hoodlum who is chosen by an overly demanding u s treasury agent david morse to be released on the streets of new york to find a picky computer thief hacker doug hutchinson who stole forty-two million dollars from the treasury and left two guards shot dead br br bait marks the sophomore feature for antoine fuqua the replacement killers and he handles the task fairly well even though it doesn't top his first movie what the two films have in common is the action sequences which are flat-out excellent br br foxx is pretty good here although his character is annoying in the beginning but throughout the film i began to catch on hutchinson is marvelous as the mastermind who can be ruthless as john malkovich and patient as the late laurence olivier was in marathon man morse is okay as the agent who comes up with the ingenious plan to get whoever did it at all cost

this tale based on two edgar allen poe pieces the fall of the house of usher dance of death poem is actually quite creepy from beginning to end it is similar to some of the old black-and white movies about people that meet in an old decrepit house for example the cat and the canary the old dark house night of terror and so on boris karloff plays a demented inventor of life-size dolls that terrorize the guests he dies early in the film or does he and the residents of the house are subjected to a number of terrifying experiences i won't go into too much detail here but it is definitely a must-see for fans of old dark house mysteries br br watch it with plenty of popcorn and soda in a darkened room br br dan basinger 8 10 
aro tolbukhin burnt alive seven people in a mission in guatemala in the 70's also he declared that he had murdered another 16 people he used to kill pregnant women and then he set them on fire br br this movie is a documentary that portraits the personality of aro through several interviews with people that got to know him and through some scenes played by actors based on real facts br br aro tolbukhin is a serious work so analytical it's not morbid at all such a horrifying testimony about how some childhood trauma can turn a man into a monster br br my rate 7 10 
after seeing several movies of villaronga i had a pretty clear opinion about him he concentrates too much on the personal aspect of the characters forgetting about a rhythm of the movie that is why though having good critics his movies never caught the broad audience attention in aro he follows the same line but really improved on the rhythm especially in the end of the movie frankly speaking i slept through the first part cause though the first part gives necessary information it is really slow nevertheless the second part is absolutely marvelous and makes the whole movie the best movie ever made by villaronga br br recommended 
there's so many things to fall for in aro tolbukhin en la mente del asesino inside the killer's mind that it's very hard to talk about it without giving any kind of warning let's just say that this movie is like an exercise in cinema but really really great done it s made with super 8 black and white shots 35 milimeters color interviews flashbacks aro tolbukhin it s like a movie made a documental or viceversa which most peculiar aspect relays on the doubt that leaves you wondering did he really ever existed the movie follows the later life of an hungarian sailor that arrived in guatemala worked in a religious mission and then killed some people an act for which he got caught and death penalty sentenced the movie starts because some french documentalists got interested in this character so they interview him prior to his death nowadays some more people got involved and make a deeper research of the character the one we are witness of the movie br br for the main part in the history we are guided by a semi slow phase to go look inside aro s mind mainly in order to decode why he did what he has done nevertheless the important thing is that the filmmakers never gives us a sided point of view they left the judging for all of us and even as we may understand his actions we clearly never justify them so the first half is based upon recollecting information later things turn into aro's childhood giving the movie such an incredible new force even tough never got weak or boring br br i don't mean and don't want to spoil anything so the only thing left to say is that if by any chance you get this movie near you believe me the trip to see it is more than worthy 
this has got to be a unique twists of two genres of ever seen the giant monster movie genre with the living mummy movie genre this unique blend makes for a unique and compelling story the casts is outstanding including tom bosley who as far as i know never has been in a horror movie before ever the effects are impressive and the idea of a giant mummy filled with smaller mummies is a cool one my one complaint i just wish we saw more of the giant mummy but other then that i think they did a great job the dialog the characters and the story was perfect the acting was wonderful this has got to be the best movie to come out of the sci-fi channel you heard me the best movie to come out of the sci-fi channel i give the fallen ones 9 out of 10 
without kirsten miller this project needn't have been completed however with the awe inspiring beauty and talent that is miss miller i would definitely recommend it it looked as if the other actors were only playing to her strong performance wagner's dismal attempt to honor this film was a bit disappointing but his few scenes didn't detract from being entertained mostly my criticisms are with the writing and plot line the group of talent assembled did a heroic job of salvaging what should have been a disaster the charismatic miller delivery and timing were impeccable and believable she plays that fine line between assertive and bossy but never offensive she is in fact the structural engineer she claims to be i wish i had seen this on the big screen but alas i was fortunate to rent it before it was lost 
sure titanic was a good movie the first time you see it but you really should see it a second time and your opinion of the film will definetly change the first time you see the movie you see the underlying love-story and think ooh how romantic the second time and i am not the only one to think this it is just annoying and you just sit there watching the movie thinking when is this d n ship going to sink and even this is not as impressive when you see it several times the acting in this film is not bad but definetly not great either was i glad dicaprio did not win an oscar for that film i mean who does he think he is anthony hopkins or denzel washington he does 1 half-good movie and won't do a film for less than 20 million and then everyone is suprised that there are hardly any films with him in it but enough about in my eyes the worst character of the film kate winslet's performance on the other hand was wonderful i also tink that the director is very talented to put a film of such a magnitude together there is one lesson to be learned about this movie there are too many love-stories as it is filmmakers shouldn't try to add a crummy romance in to every single movie out of a possible 100 i give this film a mere 71 
when i saw this movie i was stunned by what a great movie it was this is the only movie i think i would ever give a 10 star rating i am sure this movie will always be in my top 5 br br the acting is superb leonardo dicaprio and kate winslett are at their best i don't think anyone could have a better job than kate br br if it is a rainy day and you can't decide what to rent well this is the one you will love all the acting special effects and much much more br br if you have not seen this movie go rent or buy it now you won't regret it br br 
why do people bitch about this movie and not about awful movies like the godfather titanic is the greatest movie of the 21st century with great acting directing effects music and generally everything this movie is always dumped by all because one day some one said they didn't like it any more so most of the world decided to agree there is nothing wrong with this movie all i can say is that this movie not only being the most heavily oscar awarded movie of all time the most money ever made ever and sadly one of the most underrated movies i've ever seen apart from that it is truly the best movie of all time the only movies that come close to being like all the star wars and the lord of the rings trilogy or anything by the masters hitchcock or spielberg or tim burton these are all good movies and directors but none match up to james cameron's masterpiece titanic 
just two comments seven years apart hardly evidence of the film's relentless pulling-power as has been mentioned the low-budget telemovie status of 13 gantry row is a mitigating factor in its limited appeal having said that however the thing is not without merit either as entertainment or as a fright outing per se br br true the plot at its most basic is a re-working of the amityville horror only without much horror more a case of intrigue gibney might have made a more worthwhile impression if she had played halifax investigating a couple of seemingly unconnected murders with the house as the main suspect the script is better than average and the production overall of a high standard it just fails to engage the viewer particularly at key moments br br having picked the dvd up for a mere 3 95 last week at my regular video store i cannot begrudge the expenditure 10 95 would be an acceptable price for the film just don't expect fireworks 
what's inexplicable firstly the hatred towards this movie it may not be the greatest movie of all time but gimme a break it got 11 oscars for a reason it made eighteen hundred million dollars for a reason it's a damn good movie which brings to the other inexplicable aspect of it i have no idea whatsoever why this movie left such an impression on me when i saw it in theaters i've rewatched it on tv and video and it had none of the impact it had when i saw it on the big screen twice or maybe three times actually but that might be it the appeal of it it's a movie yes capital m there it's an epic it's a spectacle in the order of gone with the wind or ben hur now ben hur and gone with the wind seem kinda hokey to me with the hammy acting and excessive melodrama not that titanic has none of that well the acting was actually very good the melodrama was quite heavy-handed at times br br but the reason titanic works is that it's such an emotional ride i usually enjoy movies that stimulate the mind or give me a visual thrill this movie isn't exactly dumb but it's not cerebral at all the visual thrills are simply means to an end to fuel the emotions of the audience i didn't cry when bambi's mom died i don't react to tearjerkers but this is a tearjerker to the power of ten million an emotional rollercoaster that if it were a regular one would make buzz aldrin scream like a little girl and i'm sure that if you see it on video and have decided that you hate it and have a ready supply of cynicism then you can thoroughly dislike this movie but if you let that disbelief suspend just a bit if you give this epic melodrama the benefit of the doubt you'll enjoy it completely and look at the top ten grossing films of all time is a single one of them bad is a single one of them worth a score of 1 out of 10 no not even the phantom menace and this movie made 1 8 billion dollars worldwide it can't be bad not possible 10 10 br br p s how can anyone even consider comparing this to spiderman spiderman was a fun movie but it was a total 9 11 kneejerk that caused it to gross as much as it did it simply wasn't anything all that special no one will remember it in 50 years but i'm pretty sure titanic will be remembered 
previously i wrote that i loved titanic cried at its ending many times over and i'm a guy in his 60's i also wondered about why this great movie which won so many awards and was applauded by so many critics was given only a 7 0 rating by imdb com users br br well i looked at the breakdown of the user ratings while 29 0 of all votes gave it a 10 rating 10 7 gave it a 1 rating these 10 7 of these irrational imdb users in effect pulled the overall rating down to 7 0 br br in my previous comments i blamed this very unusual voting pattern a sudden surge in 1 ratings with a high 10 rating dropping only gradually and then suddenly reversing course and jumping at the 1 rating level on only one thing hatred for leonardo dicaprio believe me i've tuned into enough chat rooms to see the banter by young people young men mostly who defame him left and right they absolutely hate the man and they will have no part in giving him any credit in titanic to answer one other user i am not talking about someone who just really doesn't like the movie that much and gave it a 5 or a 6 etc everyone has and is entitled to his her own taste but no one can convince me that the imdb rating of only 7 0 overall for titanic pulled to that level by an inordinate number of ridiculous 1 ratings is a fair reflection of the overall motion picture br br let me demonstrate my point by comparing the imdb user voting pattern of titanic to 5 randomly chosen box office and critical bombs there are many more but these 5 will prove my point heaven's gate 1980 was pulled from the theaters quickly after a very poor box office showing and imdb voters ratings were 23 2 10 ratings and 9 2 1 ratings overall rating of 6 1 big top pee-wee 1988 got 4 3 10 ratings and 9 9 1 ratings overall rating of 4 5 cat people 1982 got 6 1 10 ratings and 2 6 1 ratings overall rating of 5 8 blind date 1987 got 3 0 10 ratings and 2 8 1 ratings overall rating of 5 3 jumpin jack flash 1986 got 4 4 10 ratings and 3 7 1 ratings overall rating of 5 2 what do all of these films have in common with titanic all of the percentages of their 1 ratings are lower than titanic and none of these stinkers ever was nominated for a single award again titanic got 10 7 1 ratings compare that to the other 5 movies i just mentioned br br can there be any explanation other than the hatred of leo factor br br 
i loved this movie since i was 7 and i saw it on the opening day it was so touching and beautiful i strongly recommend seeing for all it's a movie to watch with your family by far br br my mpaa rating pg-13 for thematic elements prolonged scenes of disastor nudity sexuality and some language 
the movie titanic makes it much more then just a night to remember it re writes a tragic history event that will always be talked about and will never been forgotten why so criticised i have no idea could will they ever make a movie like titanic that is so moving and touching every time you watch it could they ever replace such an epic masterpiece it will be almost impossible br br the director no doubt had the major impact on the film a simple disaster film boring to watch converted to an unbelievable romance yes i'm not the romance type either but that should not bother you because you will never see a romance like this guaranteed everything to the amazing effects to the music to the sublime acting br br the movie creates an amazing visual and a wonderful feeling everything looks very real and live the legend herself titanic is shown brilliantly in all classes too looks too accommodation the acting was the real effect dicaprio and winslet are simply the best at playing there roles no one could have done better they are partly the reason why the film is so great br br i guess it's not too much to talk about the plot is simple the acting is brilliant based on a true story probably more then half of the consumers that watch the film will share tears thanks to un imaginable ending which can never be forgotten well if you haven't seen this film your missing out on something hesterical and a film to idolise for hollywood could it get better no not at all the most moving film of all time don't listen to people see for yourself then you will understand a landmark don't be surprised if you cry too 
i had few problems with this film and i have heard a lot of criticisms saying it is overlong and overrated true it is over three hours long but i was amazed that it goes by so quickly i don't think it is overrated at all i think the imdb rating is perfectly decent the film looks sumptuous with gorgeous costumes and excellent effects and the direction from james cameron rarely slips from focus leonardo dicaprio gives one of his best performances as jack and kate winslet is lovely as rose david warner a great actor steals every scene he's in the story is very rich in detail and is hot on character development obvious with the love story which is very moving when it needs to be though in the first bit of the movie it is a little slow the last hour is extremely riveting and i will confess that i was on the edge of my seat when the titanic sank i will also say that the last five minutes were very moving the music score by james horner was lovely though i never was a huge fan of the song my heart will go on the 1996 miniseries was good but suffered from undeveloped scenarios and some historical inaccuracies overall i give titanic an 8 5 10 bethany cox 
i think james cameron might be becoming my favorite director because this is my second review of his movies anyway everyone remembers the rms titanic it was big fast and unsinkable until april 1912 it was all over the news and one of the biggest tragedies ever well james cameron decided to make a movie out of it but star two fictional characters to be in the spotlight instead of the ship well onto the main review but let me remind you that this is all opinion and zero fact and the only fact that will be present is an event from the film br br so our two main characters are jack leonardo dicaprio and rose kate winslet they're not annoying too much but watch this and you'll find out why they could become annoying http tinyurl com ojhoyn the main villain i guess is bad luck fate hand of god no blasphemy intended or just plain caledon hockley billy zane combine all of the above and what do you get oh yes we get a love story on a sinking boat the supporting characters are the following my personal favorite mr andrews victor garber idk he was so nice lovejoy david warner murdoch ewan stewart lightoller jonathan phillips captain smith bernard hill molly brown kathy bates and many more we also got the present day treasure hunter brock lovett bill paxton they add something to the story something good the action in here is awesome especially in the second half the drama as also good in the end you can have your eyes dropping rainstorms or silent tears the story is simple and it works a treasure hunter seeks the heart of the ocean and instead finds a drawing of a woman wearing the said diamond she calls and tells her tale on the rms titanic two lovers separated by social class and ultimately the fate of the ship everything about the story works and there are very few flaws i give titanic an 86 awesome 
titanic is a long but well made tragic adventure love story that takes place during the ill-fated voyage on the unsinkable ship writer director james cameron has done a great job of making this movie about a fictional love story between two very different people and combining that with the real event of the titanic that sunk after hitting an iceberg on april 15 1912 claiming thousands of lives who perished in the icy freeing waters of the north atlantic the two leads in the film are great in their roles including leonardo dicaprio and kate winslet they make for a good on-screen couple dicpario and winslet also had genuine chemistry together which made the romance that eventually blossoms between them that much more believable they both showed real talent when this one came out and both of them have continued to show just that in their most recently films as well the rest of the supporting cast including billy zane kathy bates frances fisher jonathan hyde and bill paxton in a small role are equally impressive as their characters who help bring them to life in this film the love story the action suspense and the special effects are magnificent done especially for that time the horror of the situation the characters were in felt so real because it really happened making you want most of them to survive this life and death situation the pacing was a little slow at times and it was a little long but the rest of the movie made up for it's few flaws titanic makes for a great date movie which is sure to make some girls cry almost every time they watch it the fact that this really happened definitely added to the movie making you feel sorry for all the lives lost when the titanic sunk into the atlantic after hitting an iceberg overall titanic is a tragic heartbreaking story about two people who fall in love while on the ill-fated ship thats brought to life by the exceptional performances from the cast especially dicaprio and winslet who definitely make this movie worth the time to watch 
the ship may have sunk but the movie didn't director james cameron from the terminator did it again with this amazing picture one of my favorite scenes is the dinner table scene in which rose's family and friends meet jack after he saves her rose has a look on her face that every woman should have when you meet the one i hope i have that look when i am in the room with my future husband br br jack and rose have a connection that is movie stuff but it's good movie stuff we have the greedy mom and all her elite stuck up associates who live off of their husbands wealth rose almost commits suicide but the gilbert grape star rescues her i really liked the hanging over the boat scene it was a good risk br br the movie is long but it's fantastic good story good flow good actors go see it twice if you want its worth it 
titanic has to be one of my all-time favorite movies it has its problems what movies don't but still it's enjoyable br br when i stumble across someone who asks me why i like titanic i suppose my first reaction is wait a minute you don't i know so many people who don't like this movie and i'm not saying i don't see why the love story is too cheesy well yes but isn't it enjoyable and moving all right the love story between jack and rose is very unrealistic everyone knows that love like this doesn't actually exist but this is a movie doesn't everyone enjoy watching a beautiful story that lets us slip slightly into fantasy for a while the next complaint dicaprio and winslet are terrible actors well ok in this movie i agree that they do not perform to their full potentials however i think it's unfair to say that they are terrible actors i personally think they are both very talented actors who unfortunately are very famous for a movie that they are not amazing in but the roles they are given are simple and the characters seem real enough that you can care about them quite a bit but i agree with many people that they did not do as well as could have been expected br br and finally if one is going to complain that they don't like this movie because they hate romance or because they hate history or tragic movies then i'm sorry but why on earth did they go and see a movie that is so clearly all of these things it's like people who complain the dark knight is a bad movie because they hate action movies simply for being a movie not because you dislike the genre this is a good movie br br well deserving of its oscars in particular best cinematography which i find to be the best i've ever seen in a movie save maybe the lord of the rings trilogy br br i know some of the writing fails such as the constant screaming of each other's names throughout the movie the flashback portion of the story can be quite weak at times but overall it's an amazing achievement in making the titanic look so real and the sinking feel so epic br br i understand why a lot of people dislike this movie but for the most part it boils down to them disliking the fundamental idea such as it being a love story rather than them thinking the movie in and of itself is poorly constructed br br i can tell you that i have read more than five books about the titanic including memoirs form the day it happened and this movie is extremely historically accurate save just a few faults the only main ones i can find is that the piping should be threaded copper not steel and the iceberg looks fairly unrealistic as is the scene where they hit it br br i give this movie 10 10 not because i like romance movies but simply because it's an outstanding cinematic achievement that leaves one feeling horrified by the realistic adaptation of events 
titanic is a classic i was really surprised that this movie didn't have a solid ten overall in the imdb user rankings maybe it's just cool to not give titanic credit nowadays but when it was first made it was really something when the movie came out people flocked to the theaters when it came out on video my sister and i would watch it twice a day for a month it was safe to say we were obsessed and for good reason some of the disaster scenes were hard to forgot like the frozen baby or the guy who committed suicide after killing someone in the unruly crowd many people died on that ship and to convey that on film with the immediacy and emotion it needed is a hard challenge that james cameron stepped up to and let's not forget the amazing romance between jack and rose whether or not their relationship was a figment of someone's imagination it was lovely they barely knew each other but they would die for each other they trusted each other they sure as hell are giving romeo and juliet a run for their money i'll never let go jack titanic is a great film down to it's very core it is a powerful story told through brilliant acting excellent cinematography beautiful music and a crew full of hard and dedicated workers it really blows my mind when someone says they hate this movie 
another aussie masterpiece this delves into the world of the unknown and the supernatural and it does very well it doesn't resort to the big special effects overkill like american flicks it focuses more on emotional impact a relatively simple plot that rebecca gibney co bring to life it follows the story of a couple who buy an old house that was supposedly home to a very old woman who never went outside and whose husband disappeared in mysterious circumstances a century ago strange things begin to happen in the house and john adam begins to turn into the man who disappeared who was actually a mass murderer highly recommended 8 10 
for me personally this film goes down in my top four of all time no exceptions james cameron has proved himself time and time again that he is a master storyteller through films such as aliens the abyss and both terminators it is clear that he was a brilliant and confidant director as far as action and science-fiction goes he sees a story and adds a strange quality to the film but titanic is so much different to his other strokes of brilliance the film is exceptionally moving and allows room for surprises plot development and interesting character developments in a story that everyone knows the story of the famed voyager sinking on her maiden voyage is legend so the challenge was for cameron to make a truthful interesting and entertaining film about it the acting is wonderful as leonardo dicaprio who plays jack and kate winslet who plays rose became superstars overnight with the release of this film and in most films i get annoyed when the supporting characters aren't given a lot to do but in this film it is more purposeful because as an elderly rose gloria stuart tells her story it is quickly apparent that it is rose's and jack's story alone no one else emotionally it is entirely satisfying and can leave no dry eye in a theater or home the music has become iconic and legendary it is composer james horner's finest soundtrack ever and evokes so much from the film and the audience the song after so long has become annoying but i still appreciate it for the phenomenon it is and this film is only one problem the usual james cameron problem is the dialogue which is memorable but in a bad way as in how cheesy it is at points but all that aside james cameron has delivered a masterpiece and a romantic epic that sweeps you away on a journey of a lifetime my heart won't go on from this one 
back in 1997 do i remember that year clinton bans cloning research the unfortunate death of princess diana the marlins won the world series and a woman gave birth to septuplets this was also the big year in the release of titanic one of the biggest films of all time a tale about the ship of dreams about a boy and a girl who fall in love but are torn apart by their social class and at the height of their emotional commitment the ship meets with disaster i don't think anybody could have expected titanic to be as huge as it was the movie was bigger than life and had millions of fans 85 of them being teenage girls i was 12 years old at the time and of course saw the movie multiple times it was the film that made me believe that the love that jack and rose shared was so real and beautiful at the time i felt that titanic could do no wrong of course i grew up and didn't watch the film since i was 14 a couple years ago i saw the film on dvd for 5 99 and figured that it was a good price and to see what i thought about the movie now was it worth the hype was it really the best movie of all time was that leonardo's real nose ok i know that's silly to say but i did re-watch the film being completely honest here titanic is a great movie best movie of all time no just depends on your idea of a good movie but titanic delivered in romance humor disaster emotions and never let us go on this maiden voyage br br the film starts with brock lovett and his team exploring the wreck of the rms titanic searching for a necklace set with a valuable blue diamond called the heart of the ocean unsuccessful they instead discover a drawing of a young woman reclining nude wearing the heart of the ocean dated the day the titanic sank 101-year old rose dawson calvert learns of the drawing and contacts lovett to inform him she is the woman in the drawing she and her granddaughter elizabeth lizzy calvert visit lovett and his skeptical team on his salvage ship when asked if she knew the whereabouts of the necklace rose calvert recalls her memories aboard the titanic revealing for the first time that she was rose dewitt bukater in 1912 the upper-class 17-year old rose boards the ship with her fianc cal hockley and her mother ruth dewitt bukater both of whom stress the importance of rose's engagement to cal since the marriage will mean the eradication of the dewitt-bukater debts while they have the outward appearance of the upper-class rose and her mother are financially broke distraught and frustrated by her engagement to the controlling cal and the pressure her mother is putting on her to go through with the marriage rose attempts suicide by jumping from the stern before she leaps a drifter and artist named jack dawson intervenes jack and rose strike up a tentative friendship as she thanks him for saving her life and he shares stories of his adventures traveling and sketching their bond deepens when they leave a stuffy first-class formal dinner of the rapport-building wealthy for a much livelier gathering of irish dance music and beer in third-class but after cal's servant informs him of rose's whereabouts rose is forbidden from seeing jack again however after witnessing a woman encouraging her seven-year old daughter to behave like a proper lady at tea rose defies him and her mother asking jack to sketch her nude and wearing only the heart of the ocean an engagement present from cal after a beautiful moment together in the very first backseat fun time they go to the deck of the ship br br they then witness the ship's fatal collision with an iceberg after overhearing the ship's lookouts discussing how serious the collision is rose tells jack they should warn her mother and cal meanwhile cal discovers rose's nude drawing and her taunting note in his safe so he frames jack for stealing the heart of the ocean by having lovejoy plant it in jack's pocket upon learning cal intends to leave jack to die below deck rose runs away from him and her mother to rescue him jack and rose return to the top deck cal and jack though enemies both want rose safe so they persuade her to board a lifeboat but after realizing that she cannot leave jack rose jumps back on the ship and reunites with jack in the ship's first class staircase jack and rose return to the top deck the lifeboats have gone and the ship finally goes down into the freezing atlantic taking jack and rose down br br so does titanic live up to it's hype i still say that this is a great movie to watch i think that there were and still are quite a few haters that for some reason just want to trash the movie because it had won a ton of awards and everyone was in love with the movie but it has great acting amazing effects a well-written story and still looks flawless love it or hate it you have to admit this movie didn't get a lot of hype just because of leo's baby face or kate's amazing ability to cry on sight this film is something special it will always hold a special place in my heart it has too seeing that i saw this film 8 times in the theater when it was released but all that aside i do recommend this movie it's a great one and sure to go down in the classics one day br br 10 10

titanic directed by james cameron presents a fictional love story on the historical setting of the titanic the plot is simple noncomplicated or not for those who love plots that twist and turn and keep you in suspense the end of the movie can be figured out within minutes of the start of the film but the love story is an interesting one however kate winslett is wonderful as rose an aristocratic young lady betrothed by cal billy zane early on the voyage rose meets jack leonardo dicaprio a lower class artist on his way to america after winning his ticket aboard titanic in a poker game if he wants something he goes and gets it unlike the upper class who are so concerned with their social worries the two fall in love and the audience sees the sinking of the titanic primarily through their eyes br br the movie begins in modern times with the exploration of the wreck by a group searching for treasures that sunk with the titanic which has recently occurred one of the survivors of the titanic rose dewitt bukater who had heard of the exploration of the wreck on television and is flown to the boat where the search is being led from to tell of what she remembers to help the search she gets to telling her memory of the one and only voyage of the titanic with this the scene shifts to southhampton ireland where the titanic set sail from on april 10 1912 as all the passengers are boarding after another stop on the irish coast titanic went out to see on its maiden voyage across the atlantic bound for new york historically the first few days of the voyage went by uneventful but the fictional plot of the story is developed during this time as rose sees the hopeless entrapement of an engagement that she is in to the wealthy cal hockley and falls in love with third class passenger jack dawson captain smith alledgedly as shown in the movie was urged by the white star line director to increase the speed of the ship so they would make the newspaper headlines and receive extra publicity by arriving in new york on thursday night and not on friday morning as planned smith then ordered the fateful decision going against his thirty-two years of experience to stretch the titanic's legs out to full speed the titanic had reports that the waters in the atlantic they were sailing in were full of icebergs but they ignored these warnings and proceeded at full speed as shown in the movie on april 15 1912 at 11 39 an iceberg was sighted they attempted to shut off the engines and turn the ship out of the path of the iceberg but there was not enough time and the ship hit the iceberg on the starboard side as depicted in the film the portrayal of the many small holes in the side of the ship and not one large gash along the side is accurate the crew of titanic sent out distress calls and set off distress rockets as shown until 2 18 when the lights finally failed the lights of the california were spotted six miles away but they failed to realize what was going on and did not respond to titanic's many pleas for help the california had tried earlier in the day to warn titanic of the severe ice that had caused them to stop their trip but titanic had brushed them off causing the california to turn off its radio and leave the titanic on its own the first class women and children were the first as depicted to be put into the twenty lifeboats that were on the ship overwhelmingly the third class passengers suffered the most amount of deaths of any class and the crew was hit hard in this tragedy too the word of white star line employees and first class passengers was believed over that of second and third class passengers when authorities were trying to gain information of the sinking also the metal that was used to build the titanic has been found in recent years under conditions of severe cold which were experienced the night titanic sank to be extremely brittle overall the basic plot is very accurate in its portayal of the events and the times at which these events took place on the titanic br br many of the characters in the story were not real and created simply for the purpose of the movie or as composite characters to represent possible characteristics and ideas of people on the ship the core group of rose jack cal and rose's mother all were fictional characters added into the story as they represent different groups of people from the time yet many characters such as the unsinkable molly brown captain edward smith the ship designer thomas andrew the white star line representative bruce ismay and all of the titanic's officers were real the maiden voyage was going to be captain edward smith's last voyage anyway as he planned to retire afterwards he had been a part of the white star line since 1880 where he worked his way up to his status as the millionaire's captain when the titanic sunk the portrayals of the officers is accurate as only four survived the tragedy except for the officer who threatened to kill all of the passengers of the ship with his pistol he is on record as acting heroicly and was misportrayed to the point that james cameron apologized and evoked a monument in his honor in the officer's former canadian hometown as shown in the movie there was a language problem between the crew and many of the lower-class passengers from non-english speaking nations in addition officer lowe was the only officer who came back in the lifeboat as depicted the old people shown in their bed as the water came in their room were based on the strauss not wanting to leave her husband's side mrs strauss refused to get in her lifeboat and died with her husband on the titanic furthermore mr goggenheim who was shown sipping his brandy and smoking a cigar reportedly did go out like this dressed in his best the richest man on the ship john jacob astor who owned most of manhattan died nonetheless as well but his much younger wife was saved in a lifeboat in addition molly brown was saved and later had medals made up for the crew of the carpethia that picked the survivors of titanic up from the water her ticket on the titanic had cost over four-thousand dollars and by the end of her life she ended up broke all of the interiors of the ship were masterfully replacated down to the last pieces of china and silverware the gymnasium which is hardly seen is recreated perfectly with all of the machines reproduced to match those seen in old photographs the wonderful outfits and costuming were an excellent re-creation of the post-victorian era of 1912 the rich at this time practically ruled everything as the women's suffrage movement had not quite gotten moving yet women during this time often married for financial security as rose was considering doing and normally took a back seast status to their husbands as cal wished for rose to do the rich did not take well to new money such as molly brown as depicted everything of the time was very formal women had to be escorted to dinner by a male figure as seen with in the dining scenes smoking was not very common among women of the time but holders of cigarettes which were just coming in at the time were used as seen with rose in the movie men of the time generally smoked cigars not cigarettes women were constained physically by their corsets and socially by society although james cameron had no background in historical films he brought in experts of titanic coupled with two years spent cross-referencing the history of the titanic and few liberties were taken the beautiful cinematography and special effects also helped to make the film even more breathtaking br br a recognizable message can be seen in the movie titanic as the people on the ship had about three hours to contemplate their demise the director james cameron shows the various reactions to this time of crisis in people's lives everyone reacts differently and he gets you to think of how you might have reacted had you been in that situation on the titanic on that fateful night in addition this film is a reflection of the 1990's when it was produced as it gives a look into the wreck of the titanic only in the past fifteen years has the site of the actual titanic been found and explored this movie was able to give us a deeper look into a disaster that many would not have viewed however the moral question of whether people today should be taking treasures from the wreck of an underwater graveyard is posed there have been attempts to stop treasure seeking missions such as the one portrayed in titanic but all have failed as it stands today anyone can make a voyage to the titanic and take whatever valuables they as portrayed in the film showing the general values of our time on this matter br br technically the film is very well done to get footage of the wreck at the bottom of the ocean it took twelve dives to get all of the footage needed for the movie in addition a special camera had to be created to withstand the intense pressure at the bottom of the ocean cameron did not plan on using the probe to go as far inside titanic as anyone has in the 88 years since the ship sunk but it worked out that this provided an unique perspective into the ship furthermore throughout the film fade ins and outs from the wreck of titanic to the scene of titanic during its actual voyage this shift between the modern scene to the past scene during the voyage works as an excellent transition that makes the story easy to follow in aclear manner at the very beginning of the movie a septune recreation is used to recreate the scene when the actual people left the european coast on titanic giving it distinction from the rest of the events of the film br br titanic plays almost like a historical biography and is like a work of art a true epic like most history novels we know the ending but it doesn't take away from the wonderful treats that can be found in this picture certain aspects of this film are academy award material including costuming sound cintematography and editing if you like interesting characters that will give you an insight into the life of characters in the early 1900's and how they face disaster then this movie definitely is for you br br 
i find it so amazing that even after all these years we are still talking about this movie obviously this movie wasn't that bad or else people wouldn't even bother to talk about it i personally enjoyed this film immensly and still do i guess this film isn't for everyone but it certainly did touch the hearts of many br br as for those that think that this film is overrated or over-hyped well we only have the movie-going public to thank for that lol you see it's not critics article writers that make a film huge or a hit with the general movie-going public people make the film a huge success with titanic everyone was in awe let's face it a film like this had never been made before at least not with the type of special effects needed to really capture the essence of the ship actually sinking this film is so accurate that even james cameron timed the actual sinking of the ship in the film with the real sinking that fateful day in april 1912 even the silverware for goodness sakes matched br br give this movie a break you guys the critics thought this movie would sink big time when this movie actually came out and people started hearing by word of mouth which is the best form of advertisement mind you that this was a good decent movie worth seeing then everyone started flocking to the theaters in droves to see this movie not once not twice but maybe 3 times and more so i really wouldn't say that this movie was overhyped at least not like the buildup for the matrix reloaded or the hulk is being overhyped ha critics didn't even think that titanic would make enough money to cover cameron's gigantic film budget that it took to make this mammoth of a film however the films money took care of that 200 million budget and much more br br personally i love this film however this film might not be for everyone don't say that this film sucks just because of romance though that is the most sexist thing i've ever heard disliking a movie just because it has romance in it the story was sweet the dialogue could have been better but let's face it the real star of the movie wasn't leo or kate it was that gigantic ship i think all of the actors including dicaprio and winslet did a fine job it's not thier best work i've seen much better work from both of them but it wasn't the worst i've seen on screen before give them a break br br 
i avoided watching this film for the longest time long before it was even released i had dismissed it as an over-hyped over-blown overly romanticized piece of hollywood schmaltz and i wanted nothing to do with it i never watched it in the theatre i shook my head in disbelief at the 11 academy awards even though i had never seen it then i was asked to be a judge at a high school public speaking contest one of the girls spoke about this movie it was so great she said you really felt like you were on the ship nonsense i thought i shared my feelings with my fellow judges one looked at me and said you might be right but if she liked the movie that much maybe she'll want to learn more about the real titanic the movie must have done something right to get her so interested well maybe thought i then it finally appeared on pay tv ok i thought i'll give it a look see i didn't want to like it and i didn't i loved it what a great movie br br where to start first the directing my high school public speaking contestant was right james cameron does a superb job of creating an almost you are there type of atmosphere the gaiety of life aboard the most elegant ship in the world the nonchalance as news of the iceberg first spreads then the rising sense of panic you don't just watch it you really do feel it then the performances the lead performances from kate winslet as rose and leonardo dicaprio as jack are excellent winslet's being the superior i thought but both were good they had their rich girl poor boy characters down to a perfect t i thought in my opinion though stealing the show was frances fisher as rose's mother she was perfect as the snobby aristocrat and you could feel the fear and loathing she felt every time she looked at jack then the details i'm no expert on the sinking of the titanic but i have a reasonable general knowledge and this film does a super job of recreating the historical details accurately and then weaving them seamlessly around the fictional romance very impressive indeed then the song who can watch this movie and not be taken with celine dion's performance of my heart goes on br br problems well the romance was perhaps too contrived in the sense that i just don't accept that jack could have moved so effortlessly from steerage to first class i know he was invited the first time but he seems to keep getting into first class without being stopped until he's been there for a while the realities of the separation of the social classes were much more realistically portrayed i thought when the steerage passengers were going to be left locked down there after the ship hit the iceberg while the first class folks got to enjoy half empty lifeboats br br a minor quibble though this is truly an excellent movie my only regret is not seeing it in the theatre where i think it would have been so much more impressive br br 9 10 
to all the miserable people who have done everything from complain about the dialogue the budget the this and the that who wants to hear it if you missed the point of this beyond-beautiful movie that's your loss the rest of us who deeply love this movie do not care what you think i am a thirthysomething guy who has seen thousands of movies in my life and this one stands in its own entity in my book it was not supposed to be a documentary or a completely factual account of what happened that night it is the most amazing love story ever attempted i know that it is the cynical 90's and the millennium has everyone in a tizzy but come on someone on this comments board complained that it made too much money how lame is that it made bundles of money in every civilized country on the planet and is the top grossing film in the planet i will gladly side with the majority this time around okay cynics time to crawl back under your rock i am done 
every once in a while the conversation will turn to favorite movies i'll mention titanic and at least a couple people will snicker i pay them no mind because i know that five years ago these same people were moved to tears by that very movie and they're too embarrassed now to admit it br br i just rewatched titanic for the first time in a long time expecting to simply enjoy the story again i was surprised to find that the movie has lost none of its power over these five years i cried again in all the same places it brought me back to 1997 when i can remember how a movie that no one thought would break even became the most popular movie of all time a movie that burst into the public consciousness like no other movie i can recall yes even more than star wars and today many people won't even admit they enjoyed it folks let's get something straight you don't look cool when you badmouth this film you look like an out of touch cynic br br no movie is perfect and this one has a few faults some of the dialogue falls flat and some of the plot surrounding the two lovers comes together a little too neatly however none of this is so distracting that it ruins the film br br leonardo dicaprio and kate winslet are wonderful leo is one of the fine actors of his generation wait til you see him in gangs of new york before you call him nothing more than a pretty boy kate winslet was so strong in this film the movie really was hers and she held it together beautifully br br james cameron managed what many believed was impossible by recreating a completely believable titanic the sinking scenes were horrific just as they were that night how anyone can say the effects were bad is beyond me i was utterly transfixed br br this film is one memorable scene after another titanic leaving port in southampton rose and jack at the bow flying iceberg right ahead the screws hanging unbelievably out of the ocean the screams of the doomed after she went down and that ending that brought even the burliest man in the theater to tears br br the music which has also been a victim of the film's success was a key ingredient james horner's score was simply perfect and the love theme was beautiful and tragic too bad celine dion's pop song version had to destroy this great bit of music for so many br br i confess i am a titanic buff as such i relished the opportunity to see the ship as we never got to see it in all its beauty perhaps watching it sink affected me more than some because i've had such an interest in the ship all my life however i doubt many of those i saw crying were titanic buffs i applaud cameron for bringing this story to the masses in a way that never demeaned the tragedy the film was made with such humanity br br another reviewer said it better than i ever could open up your hearts to titanic and you will not be disappointed 
i am not a parent neither am i a male but i was able to identify with every character's heartaches and pains br br this is a movie teenagers should watch maybe that way they will start appreciating the value of family again i'm sorry for those that don't understand the value of love family and friendship br br it was very interesting to watch patrick duffy in a different role than that of bobby ewing and it is great to see a 19 year old ben affleck giving his best in a moving and sincere performance he showed at an early age that he is capable of heartfelt drama he should be offered more serious roles note hollywoodland his first serious role in years and he went out and won best actor at the venice festival in 2006 br br this movie can be appreciated by people of all ages maybe shouldn't be watched by children under 10 because they might get scared that the same may happen to their families but i recommend it to the entire family br br i bought this movie on dvd and have watched it with friends many times because it portrays the values that are important in life 
after a brief prologue showing a masked man stalking and then slashing the throat of an older gentleman on a deserted urban turn of the century australian street we meet julie rebecca gibney and peter john adam as they go out house hunting they manage to get a loan for a fixer-upper on a posh sydney street but it turns out that physical disrepair is not the only problem with their new home it just may be haunted br br 13 gantry row combines a memorable if somewhat clich d story with good to average direction by catherine millar into a slightly above average shocker br br the biggest flaws seem partially due to budget but not wholly excusable to that hurdle a crucial problem occurs at the beginning of the film the opening thriller scene features some wonky editing freeze frames and series of stills are used to cover up the fact that there's not much action suspense should be created from staging not fancy fix it in the mix techniques there is great atmosphere in the scene from the location the lighting the fog and such but the camera should be slowly following the killer and the victim cutting back and forth from one to the other as we track down the street showing their increasing proximity the tracking and the cuts need to be slow the attack needed to be longer clearer and better blocked as it stands the scene has a strong made for television feel and a low budget one at that br br after this scene we move to the present and the flow of the film greatly improves the story has a lot of similarities to the amityville horror 1979 though the budget forces a much subtler approach millar and scriptwriter tony morphett effectively create a lot of slyly creepy scenarios often dramatic in nature instead of special effects-oriented such as the mysterious man who arrives to take away the old slabs of iron which had been bizarrely affixed to an interior wall br br for some horror fans the first section of the film might be a little heavy on realist drama at least the first half hour of the film is primarily about julie and peter trying to arrange financing for the house and then trying to settle in but morphett writes fine intelligent dialogue the material is done well enough that it's often as suspenseful as the more traditional thriller aspects that arise later especially if you've gone through similar travails while trying to buy your own house br br once they get settled and things begin to get weirder even though the special effects often leave much to be desired the ideas are good the performances help create tension there isn't an abundance of death and destruction in the film there's more of an abundance of home repair nightmares but neither menace is really the point br br the point is human relationships there are a number of character arcs that are very interesting the house exists more as a metaphor and a catalyst for stress in a romantic relationship that can make it go sour and possibly destroy it that it's in a posh neighborhood and that the relationship is between two successful yuppies shows that these problems do not only afflict those who can place blame with some external woe such as money or health problems peter's character evolves from a striving corporate employee with normal work-based friendships to someone with more desperation as he becomes subversive scheming to attain something more liberating and meaningful at the same time we learn just how shallow those professional friendships can be julie goes through an almost literal nervous breakdown but finally finds liberation when she liberates herself from her failing romantic relationship br br although 13 gantry row never quite transcends its made-for television clunkiness as a tv movie this is a pretty good one with admirable ambitions anyone fond of haunted house films psycho films or horror thrillers with a bit more metaphorical depth should find plenty to enjoy it certainly isn't worth spending 30 for a dvd that was the price my local pbs station was asking for a copy of the film after they showed it factoring in shipping and handling but it's worth a rental and it's definitely worth watching for free 
daniell steel's daddy what a refreshing story this movie glorified the importance of the family and the importance of parents in the lives of their children how rare is that in these times of heather has two mommies or what ever you fill in the blanks it is easy to see why this theme is not for everyone with the father's roles being prominent i was hoping this would be another daniell steel saga how disappointing to have it end every character was important and did a fabulous job carrying their role i would have loved to see each character develop over the years i loved this movie it is one i will defiantly watch every time it's on good story good acting and i hope this isn't a spoiler but no obtrusive sex or bad language yes it touched my heart warning get the kleenex ready what i find sad is that this side of family life is rarely depicted today in our entertainment be it television or movie's daniell if your listening you go girl give us more 
family problems abound in real life and that is what this movie is about love can hold the members together through out the ordeals and trials and that is what this movie is about one man daddy has the maturity and fortitude to sustain the family in the face of adversity the kids grow up one all be it in the hard way to realize that no matter how old they or a parent is the parent still loves their children and are willing to provide them a cushion when they fall all the actors portraying their characters did outstanding performances yes i shed a tear along the way knowing i had had similar experiences both as a young adult and later as a parent this true to life is one which every young adult and parent would do well to see although some will not realize it until they too are parents a must see for those who care about their families 
it's heart-warming to see a movie that doesn't bash males in this one the wife mother leaves her family to get in touch with herself or pursue her libido the father stays with and nurtures the kids letting neither his work nor his love life interfere with his love of and responsibility to them 
i must admit when i read the description of the genre on netflix as steamy romance i was a little bit skeptical steamy in a movie from 1968 i was prepared for disappointment and when i realized it was shot entirely in black white i knew my erotic hopes were dashed br br boy was i wrong not only does this film have all of the elements of a steamy romance the discovery of first love fear of the secret being found out a sudden unexpected end but at times this movie was downright erotic you will soon forget that it is shot in black white the cinematography deserves every accolade it has received over the years and the performances from the two stars essy persson and anna gael are intense and memorable ok so they're both in their mid twenties trying to play school girls it's 1968 do you really expect teenagers from the 60s to be able to effectively explore a lesbian love story like this many adult women were still trying to come to grips with their sexuality back then anyone looking for real teens here is expecting too much br br i think this movie was way ahead of its time the level of eroticism was an unexpected pleasure yet it still managed to leave a lot to the imagination opting instead to give us poetic descriptions to add to what we were shown br br i have no doubt lesbians will identify with the characters here as for you straight guys who love watching lesbians in action although it won't be all you expect i don't think you'll be too too disappointed 
this is a film not porn br br this is a wonderful film full of tender moments and memories a beautiful piece of work excellent for intelligent viewers only br br if you are a film lover a romantic a person who has loved deeply this is your film br br it has a beautiful surreal quality fine acting and directing watching this film made me remember my first love br br thi is a film for those who want to reflect on life love and the meaning of loss br br highly recommended for all film lovers 
it was a serious attempt to show the developing sexuality of two schoolgirls and did not try to exploit its fact even by today's standards the film is interesting and provocative br br therese and isabelle are both attending the same girl's school therese is energetic intelligent and becomes a mentor for the innocent naive sweet isabelle she guides her through a number of exotic experiences including a trip through an exclusive brothel into her first lesbian liaison and indirectly into her first heterosexual experience br br the film does not exploit any sex nor is there an abundance of nudity the imagery is effective but sometimes the camera lingers too long and the story goes slowly br br the director radley metzger went on to make a number of explicit erotic films under the name of henry paris he always has extremely detailed stories good acting and very high standards of cinematography br br artistically however this is perhaps his most complete his later attempts supplied for entertainment whereas therese and isabelle was a study into the nature of youthful eroticism 
we watched this in my women's health issues class to point out how women are treated inferior to men in many societies and i absolutely loved this movie i plan on trying to get a copy of it myself to watch the story is very touching and i would recommend it to anyone i am a fan of different cultures and this movie was just what i needed this is a movie for the whole family despite its rating this is a movie i will show to my children the professor of our class meant for the movie to primarily be a too to educate about women but this movie was more than that it is one of those movies that will forever stick out in my mind and will be a favorite 
i was going to bed with my gf last night and while she was brushing her teeth i flipped channels until i came across this chinese movie called the king of masks at first i thought it was going to be a kung fu movie so i started watching it and then it immediately captured me in and i had to finish it br br the little girl in the movie was absolutely adorble she was such a great actor for being so little maybe the fact it was in chinese so the english was dubbed made it harder for me to tell but she really seemed to be in character perfectly i felt so bad for the girl as she kept trying to please her boss but everything just turned out rotten lol even when she brings him another grandson just so he can pass on his art it turns out that kid was kidnapped so he gets arrested and has 5 days to live lol whatever she touches in an effort to be nice to her grandpa just backfires br br in the end he sees how much love is in her and teaches her the art of masks which is just so heartwarming after all the mishaps in the movie br br definitely a gem and totally original br br scott 
i admit to being somewhat jaded about the movie genre of a young child softening the heart of his her reluctant guardian i've seen enough of them baby boom kolya about a boy mostly martha and to some extent whale rider to expect to be bored by the formula what held my attention in the king of masks was the grimness of the setting small-town china in the 1930's extreme poverty was the norm and girl children were considered so worthless to poor parents that they killed them at birth or gave them to whomever would take them on the black market when wang discovers his purchased grandson whom he's nicknamed doggie is a granddaughter he initially casts her out even though she's showed great promise as street-performing heir even after he reluctantly takes her back he's not too upset when she's kidnapped the film is gritty then showing the lengths to which a young street-smart girl had to go to survive in that society br br the two lead performances are believable and beguiling in their societal context in a western society one would expect at least a hint of resentment from wang at not having achieved more material success wang so thoroughly accepts his station as a celebrated artist with low societal status though that i did too while doggie exhibits a level of precociousness and cunning that would be suspect in a modern suburban child it's completely believable in the context of a kid constantly in survival mode in a society that treats poor girls like garbage and after learning that her previous seven owners have physically and mentally abused her her fierce attachment to wang makes perfect sense br br the peek at small-town life in a foreign country the naturalness of the two lead actors the surprising plot twists and of course the heartwarming resolution all contribute to a very watchable film 
this movie is the best film ever i can't remember the last time a movie has drawn tears out of me with a tear in my eye i admire this movie it has all the elements that a good movie must have excellent dialogues music acting story plot a story of friendship courage kindliness and loyalty between a street performing who famous to the king of masks and a little girl that sold as a boy in serf bazaar little girl liked to be his granddaughter and king of masks liked a grandson they were not conventional in real every scene they were together was priceless the camera work is flawless and grips you the acting is inspired xu zhu was excellent as the king of masks renying zhou doggie looks pretty and played her character very well zhigang zhao as liang sao lang was great he played his helpful and kindhearted character extremely well if you have't this movie try it once do watch it 
verhoeven's movie was utter and complete garbage he's a disgusting hack of a director and should be ashamed by his own admission he read 2 chapters of the book got bored and decided to make the whole thing up from scratch br br heinlein would have never supported that trash if he'd been alive to see it it basically steals the name mocks politics of the book which is a good portion of it and throws in some t a so the average idiot american moviegoer doesn't get bored br br this anime isn't perfect but it's at least mostly accurate as best i can tell 
wang bianlian is an old street performer who is known as a king of masks for his mastery of sichuan change art liang is a famous opera performer of sichuan art and respects wang as an artist and as a person liang is worried that a precious art shouldn't die with wang and so he sows the seed of an heir in to wang's mind the film is about prejudices male domination state of art values and most importantly warmth br br i can't recommend this film enough the whole film is in loops everything has a significance its a long story which has been edited so well that the length of the film is just 91 minutes a total satisfaction for five minutes it is an artistic film next five minutes its a sad film next five minutes its a thriller it just keeps changing its mood like its protagonist changes his face last scene on the rope is phenomenal story and script is flawless actors are brilliant both the protagonists are artists you can tell the way they have performed very impressive it was not even nominated for oscars that year english patient got the best film oscar and in the foreign film category kolya won kolya was just ok and about english patient the lesser said the better watch it 9 10 
one of the most heart-warming foreign films i've ever seen br br the young girl is an amazing talent stellar performances by her doggie the old man the king of masks and liang the living boddhisatva br br spoiler the deplorable treatment of children especially females is disturbing br br loved the music the original chinese dialog heightens the emotional intensity of the performances and the story br br this is a must see enjoyable family film although not for very young children would have rated the dvd release even higher if the soundtrack had been transferred better onto the dvd and the transfer had included the widescreen version 
wow what a wonderful film the script is nearly perfect it appears this is the only film written by minglun wei i hope he has more stories in him br br the acting is sublime renying zhou as doggie was amazing very natural talent and xu zhu was a delight very believable as the jaded old traditionalist br br the soundtrack was very effective guiding without being overwhelming br br if only more movies like this were made whether in hollywood or hong kong a family friendly well acted well written well directed near perfect gem 
the filming is pleasant and the environment is keenly realistic i liked that it boldly redresses conceptions of the many difficult moral and social morays of the 1930's chinese-mainland countryside as well as more basic human questions i felt i could get a real sense of the times recreated even in splendid shots of traditional chinese theatre and in purist depictions of street living it seemed worthwhile to experience the interwoven role which buddhism plays is probably the most true-to form both in its menial and in its philosophic aspect perhaps the most effective that i've seen in chinese film casting is great images are memorable acting is solid enough thematically puerile but still rich enough to compliment the vehicle of its expression 
the king of masks is a beautifully told story that pits the familial gender preference towards males against human preference for love and companionship set in 1930s china during a time of floods we meet wang an elderly street performer whose talents are magical and capture the awe of all who witness him when a famous operatic performer sees and then befriends wang he invites wang to join their troupe however we learn that wang's family tradition allows him only to pass his secrets to a son learning that wang is childless wang is encouraged to find an heir before the magic is lost forever taking the advice to heart wang purchases an 8 year old to fulfill his legacy he would teach his new son doggie the ancient art of silk masks soon wang discovers a fact about doggie that threatens the rare and dying art br br together wang and doggie create a bond and experience the range of emotions that invariably accompany it the story is absorbing the setting is serene and the costuming simple summarily it is an international award winning art film which can't help but to move and inspire 
this is a superb movie suitable for all but the very youngest though accessibility for younger people was marred at least in the print which i saw by the use of some unfortunate choice of english sub-titling for much of the film it is almost impossible to guess in which time-period it is set there is no modern technology shown not even the ubiquitous chinese bicycle just a drab almost monochrome everyday life against which is contrasted the dazzling display of the sezuan opera and of celebratory fireworks even when a group of soldiers refer to their imminent departure for a theatre of war this could still be any time in the past 150 years br br but then we briefly see a motor car late 30s early 40s style and we realise that we are watching a china on the verge of huge upheavals and that much of the world we are seeing is about to be swept away in the cataclysm of world war 2 and the communist revolution br br which makes the central character's desire to adhere to old customs and traditions all the more poignant br br but the film also raises issues which are of vital importance even today both within china and in other parts of the world the inequality between boys and girls men and women the trade for various purposes in young children corruption in society injustice the importance of friendship br br maybe i'm reading too much into this film but i don't think so i also think that it is a scandal that films of this calibre are often not shown in the united kingdom whilst dross is passed off as quality material br br but don't get me started on that 
king of masks bian lian in china is a shockingly beautiful and profoundly touching film winner of 16 awards from around the world this film based on a true story centers on wang bianlian a street performer in 1930s china who is growing older but has no heir to pass on his art of face-change opera he has a unique talent of quickly changing masks in performance and no one knows how he does it he has a longing desire to have a grandson as his art is a family heirloom that can only be passed on to a male heir we then go to the streets and see that people are selling their children because they can't afford to take care of them some are even begging to take their daughters for free because daughters are not worth much in this society wang bianlian's story goes on from there br br the film was so astonishingly good the acting was amazing and the issues were so weighty and well-addressed there is the gender inequality and the depressing fact that in this time and place no one wants a little girl also interesting to note is that the famed opera actor who always plays a woman and is known as the living bodhisattva is a man who dresses as a woman and while he is famous and well-respected he regards himself as something low a half woman as we go further into the film the face the issues of human slave trade and its demand and thus the lack of a possible solution for it the brutality and corruption of the military and police and the helplessness and lack of power any individual can face due to unfortunate events or even good intentions br br this is definitely one of the best movies i have ever seen in my life and xu zhu the actor who plays wang bianlian presents yet another beautiful performance 
this is how movies are supposed to be made a fascinating setting characters about whom you come to care deeply writing and editing that move the plot efficiently and build suspense this is a wonderful film deeply moving without being sentimental highly recommended 
this movie was excellent a sad truth to how culture tends to clash with the sexes this is just one big warm fuzzy type of movie you have the master who is steeped in tradition and kind hearted in his own way doggie despite being a girl thing to win his affections and you top it off with one cute monkey with a thousand facial expressions this equals on big happy movie in the end this movie does a good job at showing how steeped in tradition one can be so steeped that they are willing to die without sharing their secrets you see sides to a culture never seen before which helps enhance the drama that unfolds near the end of the picture the cinema-photography is excellent in particular the opening parade sequence with all the sparkers bound to be in oscar contention for best foreign film 
this movie is worth seeing for the visual beauty and moving acting alone but there also is an interesting cultural subtext of alienation women and performers both brought together in a supporting role of a transvestite opera star are both doomed to be relegated to subserviant roles in china this makes the unlikely bonding between an aged street performer and a young girl even stronger as a triumph over the native culture br br the only problem i had with this movie was the tendency of the soundtrack to swell up with emotion rendered unnecessary by the actors performance br br a welcome alternative to unsatisfying summer action movies 
robert a heinlein's classic novel starship troopers has been messed around with in recent years in everything to paul verhoeven's 1997 film to a tv series to a number of games but none of these so to speak has really captured the spirit of his novel the games are usually unrelated the tv series was more of a spin off and the less said about verhoeven's film the better little do most know however that in japan an animated adaptation had already been done released the year of heinlein's death and believe it or not despite its differences this 6-part animated series is plot-wise the most faithful adaptation of heinlein's classic br br the most obvious plus to this series is the presence of the powered armor exoskeletons something we were deprived of in verhoeven's film like the book the series focuses more on the characters and their relationships than on action and space travel though we see a fair amount of each while events happen differently than in the book the feel of the book's plot is present rico and carmen have a romantic entanglement but it's only slightly more touched upon than in the book while some may believe the dialogue and character interaction to be a bit inferior to the book it gets a bit of the anime treatment but what did you expect but it's far superior to the film heinlein's political views are merely excised as opposed to the film where they are reversed the big payoff of the series however is the climatic battle on klendathu between the troopers and the bugs aliens which features the kind of action from the powered armor suits we would have like to have seen in a film version br br overall i enjoyed this series because i wanted to see a vision closer to that of heinlein and i think they did pretty well with this if you can find this series give it a look 
as i was watching this film on video last night i kept getting these tingles that told me this one will endure i've a feeling i'll be watching this again and again for years to come br br it's got all the timeless qualities you could ask for in a story film and even though some cultural references are obscure for me a western viewer at the core this is a universal tale 
when tradition dictates that an artist must pass his great skills and magic on to an heir the aging and very proud street performer known to all as the king of masks becomes desperate for a young man apprentice to adopt and cultivate br br his warmth and humanity tho find him paying a few dollars for a little person displaced by china's devastating natural disasters in this case massive flooding in the 1930's br br he takes his new 7 year old companion onto his straw houseboat to live with his prized and beautiful monkey general only to discover that the he-child is a she-child br br his life is instantly transformed as the love he feels for this little slave girl becomes entwined in the stupifying tradition that requires him to pass his art on only to a young man br br there are many stories inside this one many people are touched and the culture of china opens itself for our western eye to observe thousands of years of heritage boil down into a teacup of drama and few will leave this dvd behind with a dry eye br br the technical transfer itself is not that great as i found the sound levels all over the meter and could actually see the video transfer lines in several parts of the movie highly recommended 9 10 stars 
an unexpected pleasure as i had heard nothing about this film br br shameful since it warrants having a wider audience br br a wonderfully humane story with a social message gently told although admittedly predictable in its resolution solidly acted by the principals beautifully photographed with muted colors floating against grey that captures the nostalgic tone of the film br br my recent foray into chinese film shower the road home not one less has been an exciting one that i hope to continue exploring china and its people is an amazing canvas for film-makers the king of masks can be highly recommended as a starting point for anyone similarly interested in recent chinese film br br 
one of the great things about many of the superb chinese movies you can find if you are lucky in the video stores is they are very accurate retellings of actual true stories farewell my concubine the emperor and the assassin and this movie are perfect examples the film makers take a true story and work hard to accurately create a movie without compromising the facts for dramatic or commercial convenience the hallmark of much hollywood and especially disney films br br in this story we follow the later years of an famous local street performer dubbed the king of masks for his mastery of sichuan change art along an having lost his only son many years earlier he searches to find a male heir to carry on his rare and dying art in a society that forbids females to have such work master wang is sold a son by a slave trader all is well as he joyfully prepares to pass down his art but the son eventually is found out to be a girl from there the story get very interesting with a good performance by master liang of the sichuan opera a regional operatic style related to peking opera fans of farewell my concubine should look carefully at master liang's portrayal of a male playing the female role in chinese opera it may help them come to understand that the players of these female roles were probably not homosexuals or castrati but people who have be so psychologically conditioned as to be totally unaware of their own sexuality 
quote by nicolas martin nicmart from houston tx fine film but dvd reformatted for tv 8 april 2002 this is a charming and emotive film on the other hand the dvd i purchased has been reformatted to fit your tv by the clods at columbia tristar there is no excuse for not providing the film in widescreen format except that hollywood treats all films like the moronic disposable trash that it is so used to producing what a shame br br what a criminal shame indeed however there is another version out though see here for details http www dvdbeaver com film dvdcompare2 kingofmasks htm br br wonderful performances by the two main actors the king and doggie btw 
masks is a moving film that works on many levels at its simplest it is the haunting story of a street performer who bonds with a young child while trying to pass along his creative art masks to the next generation although at times the story makes the old man into a job it is so well crafted written acted directed wonderful production values it is easy to move beyond his plight and if you hang with it the film is ultimately very sweet and uplifting kudos all around this is a wonderful film for children as well as adults the trick is how to get americans who may not like foreign language films to see it 
beautiful and touching movie rich colors great settings good acting and one of the most charming movies i have seen in a while i never saw such an interesting setting when i was in china my wife liked it so much she asked me to log on and rate it so other would enjoy too 
this is probably my favorite movie of all time it is perfection in its storytelling it will break your heart not because it's over sentimental but because you will truly feel every emotion these characters go through you feel for doggie because of the hopeless situation that existed for young girls in china at that time 
it's a tale that could have taken place anywhere really given the right circumstances street entertainer catching the attention of famous opera star and friendship ensuing the aging entertainer finds buys a male child to pass his art to from there we follow them through the rigors of their challenging but free life along the river traveling town to town he performs and has some degree of notoriety despite the times and the influences the man is kind and good br br overall the performances are first rate especially xu zhu who portrays the street performer the child renying zhou is beautiful and downright strong and withstands the overt prejudices well the two protagonists along with supporting help from the kind opera singer master liang an interestingly androgynous zhao zhigang paint a very interesting tale of forgiveness sadness and love some have mentioned this film's remote similarities to ba wang bie ji farewell my concubine yet this film can't stand easily on its own any resemblance is remote at best br br my only qualm with the king of masks is the ending it was weak cliche and about as subtle as a sledgehammer the audience was already wrapped up in the story what was the needless manipulation for what a shame to bring a fine motion picture that far only to surrender to emotional and corny pathos like that it frankly made this film good instead of the classic it should've been that aside the king of masks is still very well worth your time i was happy to see the shaw brothers are still producing good films highly recommended 
i enjoyed the cinematographic recreation of china in the 1930s in this beautiful film the story is simple an older male performer wants to pass on his art to a young man although he has no living children the faces of the actors are marvelous to see the story reveals the devotion and gratitude of children to those who treat them well and their longing to be treated well the operas in the film remind me of farewell my concubine which was more sophisticated and intricate the story here reminds me of a dickens tale of days when children were almost chattel the plot is a bit predictable and a bit too sentimental for me but well worth the time to view for the heroism humanity and history portrayed 
ok let's get this clear i'm really not into sci-fi but for some reason i love stargate sg-1 br br jack o'neil takes his team sg-1 through a stargate a round device that creates a wormhole it gives you the ability to travel to distant worlds it might sound like your usual sci-fi series but it's not the plot is set today not in some distant millennium like many other sci-fi series i find that great it gives you things happenings and such you can relate to and you can jump into the series at any time without having to learn many new terms and names of all the gadgets they have some of course but thanks to o'neil who likes to keep a simple terminology there's not many br br the series has a nice blending of action humor and drama if you enjoy loads of special effects you're not going to find it here they don't use many bad ones but a limited amount of well made special effects 
in the rapid economic development of 1990's in china there is a resurgence of traditional chinese culture partially due to the rise of nationalism accompanied by the increase in wealth and more importantly due to the sense of spiritual belonging after the collapse of the old socialist ideology in the post cultural-revolutionary era br br however the resurgence of chinese traditional culture namely the confucianism was not without disasters because chinese are adopted the entire tradition without eliminating the bad part and the discrimination against girls demonstrated in this film is an excellent example br br moreover not only the part that should be discarded were inherited the good part that was supposed to be inherited such as the traditional opera and its technique such as changing face was ignored in the resurgence and facing extinction br br the director used this film to criticize the problem of re-embracing tradition by contemporary china and this is the deeper meaning behind the movie 
this is a beautiful rich and very well-executed film with a rich and meaningful story basically it tells how an old master story teller needs to find a male heir to carry on his craft but ends up not getting what he expected in his very male-dominated world the characters must then deal with their situation and the old master must grapple with the conflict between his desire for a companion and heir and his and society's traditional notions br br the story is fun emotional and complex the exploration of the characters their lives and emotions is rich and compelling the character development is strong while the characters are complex and not one dimensional at all the film expertly conveys the old man's emotions and his desire to find an heir and compellingly shows how he and the kid handle the situation there is also humour sometimes quite subtle at appropriate points the film also examines the good and bad of traditional chinese culture creating further interest and depth to the film br br the directing acting and scenery are all outstanding added to the other strengths this creates rich and convincing visual images and compelling real characters as a result the film evokes strong empathy for and feelings about the characters br br some have claimed that the ending weakens the film but i do not necessarily agree perhaps it could have been stronger with a different ending but any improvement in the overall film would have been rather small 
the movie is truly poignant unique and uplifting the story is universal in that it's a battle between good evil and the world between the most important thing is that its rating is wrong misleading and a travesty blockbuster has it rated as though it were an x rated movie the truth is is that it is closer to g than pg and should be seen by children who can read the clear and simple sub-titles 
the fact that this film was put out on dvd still formatted-to tv and with a fuzzy picture really annoyed a lot of film purists and rightly so this deserves a lot better treatment br br the story is about a street performer who needs a son to pass on his craft the rules of the day and winds up with a little girl instead not the conventional way and the problems that ensue afterward the old man had bought the kid at a slave auction and soon discovers the kid is not a boy which he obviously thought was the case br br the old man bianlian wang xu zhu is kind of funny-looking with a missing front tooth and an infectious grin the little girl doggie zhou renying is a cutie the rest of the story is how the two manage after that i usually like a nice sentimental ending but this gets a bit carried away in the final 15 minutes br br overall it's involving story complete with drama suspense humor and sadness just don't expect a good quality picture for the money you are spending on the dvd until it comes out on widescreen rent it 
this spectacular film is one of the most amazing movies i have ever seen it shows a china i had never seen or imagined and i believe it shows 1930's china in the most real light ever seen in a movie it is absolutely heart-breaking in so many situations seeing how hard life was for the characters and yet the story and the ending are incredibly joyful you truly see the depths and heigths of human existence in this film the actors are all perfect such that you feel like you have really entered a different world br br i simply can not recommend this movie highly enough it may just change you forever once you have seen it 
i just saw this movie today with my children son 10 and daughter 4 5 at the 3rd annual roger ebert overlooked film festival after the film the children in the audience were allowed to ask questions to the director tian-ming wu he through a translator told several stories about his life and the making of the film br br all tangents aside both of my children really enjoyed this movie of course i had to paraphrase many of the subtitles for my daughter but much of the film is visually self-explanatory br br i won't give anything away but the bottom line is that this film is so much better than 95 of the hollywood crap especially children's films out there br br cheers br br p s there is a real original king of masks who can could do 12 masks at once the actor in the movie trained and learned to do up to 4 masks at a time then they would cut and change to 4 new masks 
this is a lot of silliness about a woman from london who marries a tea planter from ceylon whom she barely knows it's full of cliches and the liz taylor character is not believable it has a marvelous set some exotic location footage it shows taylor at the height of her beauty she looks stunning 
fabulous costumes by edith head who painted them on liz taylor at her finest br br the sfx are very good for a movie of its age and the stunt doubles actually looked like the actors even down to body type a rarity in movies of this vintage br br a cozy movie with splendid panoramas even when chopped down to pan and scan 
elephant walk 1954 starring an early peter finch as lord of the manor in some god-forsaken plantation where there is always the danger of elephants or mad englishmen staying out in the midday sun and going berserk well eventually they do after the typhoid or cholera outbreak of course and much mayhem ensues taylor replaced an ailing vivien leigh in this pot boiler adventure flick when the elephants storm the house and trap liz on the grand staircase i still get goose bumps thank goodness dana andrews is around to save the day one of my favorite guilty pleasures in color too 
or type on a computer keyboard they'd probably give this eponymous film a rating of 10 after all no elephants are shown being killed during the movie it is not even implied that any are hurt to the contrary the master of elephant walk john wiley peter finch complains that he cannot shoot any of the pachyderms no matter how menacing without a permit from the government and his tone suggests such permits are not within the realm of probability furthermore the elements conspire in the form of an unusual drought and a human cholera epidemic to leave the wiley plantation house vulnerable to total destruction by the elephant people as the natives dub them to close the story if you happen to see the current release earth you'll detect the elephant people are faring less well today 
i got in to this excellent program in about season 4 and since then i have seen all the episodes got all the episodes on dvd and keeps getting better and better with the seasons of 9 and 10 it now may not have richard dean anderson now but the addition of ben browder and claudie black it has still given the show more strength and original still even after 10 seasons sadly now the sci-fi channel got rid of this amazing show with no hope relay for a 11 season there are making two direct to dvd movie and hopefully more atlantis is still going strong on its 4th seasons and there is a third spin off in the works the stargate franchise is nowhere near dead this tv show is a must see for all sci-fi fans and people of genres because this has such a wide range of things to appeal to all ages and all types of people watch it 10 10 
i was prepared for a turgid talky soap opera cum travelogue but was pleased to find a fast-paced script an underlying moral excellent portrayals from all the actors especially peter finch amazing special effects suspense and beautiful cinematography there's even a shot of the majestic stone buddhas recently destroyed by the taliban not to mention elizabeth taylor at her most gloriously beautiful and sympathetic before she gave in to the gaspy hysterics that marred her later work all the supporting players round it out and i do wonder who trained all those elephants br br speaking of the stone-buddha sequence you really can discern that it's vivien leigh in the long shots her shape and the way she moves is distinct from taylor's the only thing marring that sequence are the poorly done process shots where the background moves by much too fast for horses at a walk br br if you want a thought-provoking film that is beautiful to watch and never boring spend a few hours with elephant walk 
i watched elephant walk for the first time in about 30 years and was struck by how similar the story line is to the greatly superior rebecca as others have said you have the sweet young thing swept off her feet by the alternately charming and brooding lord of the manor only to find her marriage threatened by the inescapable memory of a larger-than life yet deeply flawed relative you have the stern and disapproving servant a crisis that will either bind the couple together or tear them irreparably apart climaxed by the fiery destruction of the lavish homestead br br meanwhile elephant walk also owes some of its creepy jungle atmosphere to the letter the bette davis love triangle set on a singapore rubber plantation rather than a sri lankan tea plantation br br maltin gives elephant walk just two stars and imdb readers aren't much kinder but i enjoyed it despite its predictability elizabeth taylor never looked lovelier and peter finch does a credible job as the basically good man unable to shake off the influence of his overbearing father dana andrews a favorite in laura and the best year of our lives is wasted as elizabeth's frustrated admirer the real star is the bungalow one of the most beautiful interior sets in movie history 
the scintillating elizabeth taylor stars in this lesser-known classic as a young girl from london who falls in love with a tea plantation owner from british ceylon current day sri lanka upon arrival she instantly feels out of place and is forced to adapt to the new culture as well as be in constant awareness of the angry elephant herd william dieterle who also directed the life of emile zola and portrait of jennie does a masterful job of bringing a somewhat dark and almost eerie undertone to this romance and the setting is one of the most beautiful i've seen with the black and white themed mansion and the gorgeous island scenery 
a beautiful shopgirl in london is swept off her feet by a millionaire tea plantation owner and soon finds herself married and living with him at his villa in british ceylon although based upon the book by robert standish this initial set-up is highly reminiscent of hitchock's rebecca with leading lady elizabeth taylor clashing with the imposing chief of staff at the mansion and almost immediately her own husband who is still under the thumb of his deceased-but dominant father taylor a last-minute substitute for an ailing vivien leigh looks creamy-smooth in her high fashion wardrobe and her performance is quite strong however once husband peter finch starts drinking heavily and barking orders at her one might think her dedication to him rather masochistic this feeling hampers the ending as well still the film offers a heady lot for soap buffs romantic drama a bit of travelogue interpretive dance an elephant stampede and a perfectly-timed outbreak of cholera from 
elephant walk may not be the acme of literature or of film but it is great entertainment in the quasi-melodramatic mode it is the story of love both genuine and illicit as well as overweening ambition devotion and the arrogance of personal tyranny a previous reviewer john mankin questions why the central focus of the film the mansion called elephant walk should have been built by the former owner the governor the late tom wiley right across the elephants traditional path to the major source of water the river to miss this point is to essentially miss the point of the whole center of the film the hubris of man that his son played by peter finch should become enthralled by the super image and enigma of his revered father is not unexpected since the son was without a mother growing up in a foreign jungle with only his father and his father's rowdy boys club as his role models the point of the father was that he was a self-made man who would tame nature to his liking and that liking was not just a tea plantation upon the lands the elephants once dominated but also that he would dominate even the large bull elephant that led the herd and thus he would dominate his son and all around him and so we join the tale after the elephants have been denied the crucial dry season access to their pathway to water who could know that this dry season would last so long and what the elephants would do in desperation to get water this is the nexus of the film what will animals do to get water what will humans do to get power or love ceylon today's sri lanka is the huge island off the coast of india where the plantation is located and one quickly learns that it is the real scenery of the story not just the expenses of miss taylor were it not for this exotic location much of the film was shot in ceylon and the magnificent bungalow this would have been just another potboiler one must recognize the atmosphere created here as integral to the time and place as it illuminates the latter day wealth and power attained by the english immigrant conquerors that were part and parcel of the british raj it is only such wealth gained by the use of virtual slave labor that one could build so magnificent a residence of ebony teak and marble not to be overlooked are the wonderfully carved jalees grille work window and doorway borders evidently specified by art directors j mcmillan johnson and hal pereira and obviously made by the cheaper labor on the island such craftsmanship reveals the careful attention to detail that these men sought br br for those immune to the blandishments of time place and architecture there is always the allure of miss taylor as she marries a man she doesn't really know and is tacitly wooed by a another man against the background described and under the overarching tyranny of the legacy of a man deceased as i said it is not great literature nor even great film but it is great spectacle long before that term was debased by the special effects extravaganzas of today br br this is one of those films made to be seen on the giant screen of an outdoor drive-in not on the home tv so arrange the largest screen to see it on to fully appreciate its fine camera-work and scope 
my parents took me to this movie when i was nine years old i have never forgotten it i had never before seen anything as beautiful as elizabeth taylor she was twenty-two when she made elephant walk remember i'm nine so the feelings aren't sexual i just couldn't see anything else on the screen i just wanted to sit at her feet like a puppy and stare up at her she has begun to show her age she's almost seventy-four but i still believe her to be one of the most beautiful and breathtaking women to ever have lived br br i have seen the movie several times since and it is a sappy melodrama what saves it is of course miss taylor's beauty magnificent scenery the very impressive elephant stampede and a well-made point on human arrogance in the face of nature br br all in all a well-spent couple of hours watching the movie channel or a rented video 
robert standish's novel is about a triangular romantic situation on a ceylonese tea plantation so the events of the ceylon backgrounds and pictorial beauty are rewarding points to william dieterle's film br br the story is about a rich powerful planter peter finch who brings a charming and tender beauty elizabeth taylor into the jungle as his bride the plantation of course is endangered by some kind of wild life for this reason taylor elegant as never in dazzling costumes finds herself in a strange atmosphere the echo determination of a ghost the bad temper of a husband obsessed by the memory of his autocratic father a highly dangerous disease and the fury of wild animals br br in her confusion boredom and annoyance elizabeth taylor looks to a friendly face a pretentious foreman dana andrews who admires her beauty but tries to conquer her love br br with echoes of jane eyre the mysterious yorkshire mansion with a brooding master and rebecca the innocent young second wife hunted by the image of the glamorous first wife elephant walk is a menace melodrama with a wide view of a huge tropical bungalow exotic dances with rage excessively colorful stampeding big bull elephants amazing mansion set on fire all in the company of an exquisite creature with an unquestioned beauty and talent br br the movie gave liz a change of scenery and allowed her more creative energy and self-respect than most of her other willful debutante-rebels the wife here has a sharp tongue and a strong will and so taylor plays her movie star heroine with more spirit than she was given credit for 
one of the first ova's original video animation i ever bought this still has to be one of my favourite anime titles a cyberpunk sci-fi action comedy set against an unlikely for a comedy that is background of near-future pollution in a dystopian society br br the heroes of dominion are the tank police formed with a if we can't beat crime we'll get bigger guns philosophy and who are like the name suggests patrolling the city in tanks instead of patrol cars and who are actually far more dangerous than any criminals they are trying to catch most if not all of these cops are borderline psychopaths and neurotics giving new meaning to the phrase loose cannons br br equally colourful and amusing are their adversaries terrorist buaku and his hench wo men the twin cat sisters whose existence always seems to involve giving the tank police a hard time br br the animation is not state of the art but it's very nice otherwise the colourful palette and cartoonish look of the characters and mecha fit nicely with the comedic atmosphere of dominion br br the english dubbing is again lots of fun the soundtrack of the english version is also very good i wonder if they ever made a soundtrack album of that br br anyway dominion tank police is great it's japanese cyberpunk sf with lots of comedy filled with completely over-the top characters and situations making sure that it never takes itself seriously highly recommended 
dominion tank police is without a shell of a doubt one of the most amazing shows ever produced but not just in the field of animation while the first part acts 1 and 2 mostly consists of action and fun the second part is more serious and one should not treat the second part in the exact same way as first part the subtleties are truly out of this world and the characterization is beyond brilliant you must have an extra degree of intelligence to appreciate the intricacies of the second part acts-3 and 4 i do have some complaints though in the first part the tank bonaparte quite literally jumps over a tank shell and it did not make any sense at all one might also question the plausibility of bonaparte jumping on the wing of helicopter gunship even though it was cool buaku rules 
the anime that got me hooked on anime br br set in the year 2010 hey that's not too far away now the earth is now poison gas wasteland of pollution and violence seeing as how crimes are happening ever 30 seconds are so and committed by thieves who have the fire power of third world terrorists the government of the fictional new port city form the tank police to deal with the problem cops with tanks oh the insanity br br the heroes of this series include the new recruit leona ozaki a red haired japanese woman yeah i know they never match their distinctly japanese names with a japanese appearance who has just been drafted into the tank police and is quickly partnered with blond blue eyed nice guy al leona is new at using tanks and unfortunately she destroys the favorite tank of tank police commander charles britain also known as brenten a big guy who looks like tom selleck on steroids and sporting a pair of nifty sunglasses a big revolver and a bad temper britain didn't like having leona join the tank police in the first place and her wrecking his tiger special a giant green monster tank doesn't exactly endear her to him nor is he fond of her taking the remains of his giant tank and using it to build a mini-tank that she nicknames bonaparte and he is soon pushing to have her transferred to child welfare where the boys are more your size as he puts it there's also specs the bifocal genius bible quoting god fearing chaplain purple mo-hawked mohican and the pot bellied chief who's right on the edge thanks to the mayor always yelling at him about the tank police antics seeing as how the tank cops often destroy half the city while chasing the bad guys and use extreme violence to capture them they're not very well liked by the people br br the villains are a cyborg named buaku who's got a mysterious past that's connected with a project known as green peace his gang and his two sexy cat cyborg sidekicks anna uni puma in the first installment these guys are being paid to steal urine samples from a hospital treating people who haven't been infected by the poison gas clouds and in the 2nd they're hired to steal a painting that is of a naked buaku the story however was uncompleted in the anime and was finished up in a cult comic manga book that's very hard to find br br all sorts of chaos and mayhem ensue in this black comic venture that examines how far people want their police to go in order to catch criminals and what happens when the fine line between good guys and bad guys starts to get blurred this is the kind of thing that if you were going to make a movie of it you'd better go get quentin tarantino uneven in places but still a lot of fun br br followed by new dominion tank police 
fact stargate sg-1 is a cheesy sci-fi tv series br br there's no escaping facts how much you try to excuse yourself or explain it stargate sg-1 remains a cheesy sci-fi tv series br br stargate sg-1 does borrow and steal ideas briskly special fx aren't nearly as impressive as they could have been and the action isn't going to blow you out of the chair or couch for that matter either br br but and this is where i really think stargate sg-1 deserves all the credit it can get for each and every episode or stolen idea i think you can count at least one cheesy sci-fi movie that's actually worse than a one hour tv episode br br in fact some episodes actually could probably have been 90 minutes long and still have been better than most movies br br and being able to keep that quality throughout the show and keep delivering and pushing the storyline further is what makes stargate sg-1 special br br i am very picky with my selections i follow perhaps one or two tv series at most and i hold pretty high standards which made me even more surprised when i found myself caught br br so for those who decide to brush of stargate sg-1 as yet another tacky sci-fi show don't stick with it and you'll see what i'm talking about 
scott bartlett's offon is nine minutes of pure craziness it is a full-frontal assault of psychedelic pulsating epilepsy-inducing flashing lights and colours and the first true merging of film and video in avante-garde cinema there's no story to speak of but bartlett uses images of nature particularly the human face and form to provoke a sequence of emotional reactions integrating these biological phenomena into the highly-industrial form of modern technology in a sense the film represents the merging of humanity into his tools his machinery his technology this theme connects loosely with the subplot of hal9000 in stanley kubrick's 2001 a space odyssey 1968 and indeed bartlett's opening sequence of images flashing colours before a close-up human eye recalls dave bowman's journey through the stargate the visuals are richly-coloured a confronting blend of sharp vivid photography and increasingly-grainy video as though we're sitting too close to a television screen as a matter of fact the end product was recorded from a tv monitor br br there appears to be some confusion about the film's release date imdb lists the film as a 1972 release but both the national film registry and the national film preservation foundation give 1968 as the correct year perhaps this disparity reflects the time between the film's completion and its first public screening either way the visuals are distinctly ahead of their time occasionally reminiscent of a 1980s music video and some brisk techno music wouldn't have gone amiss either offon captures grainy fragmented images presenting life from the warped perspective of a computer processing too much information i had a thought and please don't laugh at this free-thinking interpretation that an extraterrestrial civilisation capturing earth's television signals might very well receive such a disjointed alien documentation of human life a bizarre montage of only vaguely-familiar imagery that couldn't possibly make any coherent sense perhaps this is where mankind with all his technology is eventually heading towards an irreversible merging of film and video of purity and artificiality 
i stumbled across this act-i by pure dumb luck and this was more than a decade ago this was'nt even what the cover label on the tape mentioned it amazed me it intimidated me it shocked me i eventually forgot about and almost a decade later i happened to think about it again then went and bought both acts they were even better than i had experienced at first br br my only complaint is that while the tank police keep on going on and on about being at war with crime warranting tanks and heavy artillery it would seem as though they are really having a hard time with criminals that is either never shown or is simply a lie as they appear to be taking it easy most of the time if that bit about being in a state of war was really propaganda it certainly has not been shown as such br br i don't think the original japanese version could have been any where as good as the americanized version of this but regarding the story there has certainly been some proper explanations lost in translation but it can be excused 
dominion tank police is an exercise in contradictive film making the storyline across the 4 parts blends mindless action slap-stick humor touching humanity and thought provoking philosophical questions it's hard to believe that there was only one director as the style changes from episode to episode a must-see movie for anyone who likes anime 
i have to start saying it has been a long time since i have seen it but have seen it 5 or more times a wonderful little romp that was clearly inspired by the musical comedy pairings of new or fading stars with musical groups of prominence kay kyser's mysteries would be a good example br br having spike jones unleashed is the best part of the show as he and his band play many tunes and are a part of the action doing a fine job of support hugh o'brien plays the face buddy hackett the part rumor has it that was offered to lou costello and thus abbott and costello replacing the leads don't know if that was true br br all in all a pleasant movie but important to have that much spike jones and his band on film for history wish that it was released as i haven't seen or heard of it now in two decades hope it is not lost 
i've spent years looking for a copy of this film 16mm dvd vhs so i could show it to my kids the movie is funny and spike and the members of his band show why they were the best musicians in the business they had to be that good to play that demented i like it and recommend it for movie lovers of all ages br br the movie is about a turn of the century firehouse with a crew of misfits that are firemen and the department band when not fighting the fires there's the usual running gags plus the mayhem of spike jones and his orchestra also comedy relief provided by comedian buddy hackett and straight-man hugh o'brien 
the performance by om puri smita patil and sadashiv amrapurkar and the whole chemistry comes off nicely along with the minimalist approach to story telling and direction by govind nihlani the dialogues by vijay tendulkar is also great br br i have not seen another movie like this it is one whole each piece so nicely fit in the plot you cannot not be impressed by this movie br br amrish puri comes off as the bossy husband and baap of om puri om puri is the young man caught between his sense of duty and his inability to fight the system sadhashiv as rama shetty gives just about the right touch to the movie with his smiling and soft speaking villain the first meeting of anand velankar with rama shetty's at sadhashiv's place is absoulely stunning smita patil does not play a main role but her part is also not distracting from the main plot br br and to add to this all kafi inamdar plays the role of a cop who has come to terms with the system and its workings saying right things in the right places and knowing how to keep himself away from trouble he is also the guru of om puri and helps him whenever he gets into trouble br br the movie not only brings to focus the difficulties faced by a police officer trying to do his duty but also the other side of brutalities in police custody om puri captures hopelessness and the burning desire to break free in this exceptional performance in ardh satya br br a treat to all avid fans of indian cinema 
directed by govind nihalani this is definite cop film of indian cinema may be the first one which portrayed the stark reality of corruption in the police force politics with no holds barred how it effects on a young cop a man forced to join a career of a cop by his cop father agreed that we grew up watching lot of good cop bad cop hindi films but this is different today's generation which grown up watching dark realistic films like satya company may be consider it inferior product in comparison but look at the time of its making the film was made absolutely off beat tone in the time when people didn't pay much attention to such kind of cinema yet it becomes a most sought after cop film in class mass audience when it released for om puri its first breakthrough in mainstream hindi cinema he delivered a class performance as inspector velankar its more than cop character he internalized a lot which is something original in acting watch his scenes with his father whom he hates smita whom he loves smita patil maintained the dignity of her character to the expected level my god what a natural expressions she carried shafi inamdar was truly a discovery for me he's a brilliant character actor if given a chance here in some of the scenes he outsmarted even om the movie is also a debut of a promising villain on indian screen sadashiv amrapurkar as rama shetty it's another story that he didn't get such a meaty role almost forgotten today as one of the loud villain of dharmendra's b grade action films watch the scene where om 1st time becomes a rebel for his father played by amrish puri next both are sharing wine together how inner truth started revealing for both the character with confronting feelings of love hate for each other two faces of indian police force masculinity impotency and in between lies half truth ardh satya kudos to nihalani's touch the film won 2 national awards as best hindi feature film best actor om puri 3 filmfare awards in best film best director best supporting actor categories br br recommended to all who are interested in nostalgia of serious hindi films br br ratings 8 10 
after aakrosh this was the second film for govind nihalani as a director till this movie was made there was no audience for documentaries in india this movie proved a point that a documentary can fulfil the requirements of a commercial film without diluting its essence it was one of the successful movies in the year in which it was released this movie contested against the big banners of the bollywood like'coolie betaab hero in 1983 br br smithapatel in this movie acted more like a conscience of the hero whenever he drifted away or lost his composure she was there to remind him she was not like an usual heroine to do the usual stuff of running around the trees and shrubs at one time she even gave up her love when the hero's ruthlessness touched the roof top br br there was another character in this movie which was played by om puri contemporary naseeruddin shah he played as an inspector-turned alcoholic character the role conveyed the message of the end result of a honest cop who rubbed the wrong side of the system which also gave the viewers a chance to forecast the hero's ending br br in his debut film sadashiv amrapurkar captivated the audience with his cameo role which ultimately won him the best supporting actor by the filmfare the cop in the movie was not a complete straight forward personality he was able to adjust to the system to an extent the anger which left half handedly continued in govind nihalani's other film drohkaal even after two decades this movie is remembered just because of the director and the entire crew each one played their part par excellence 
ardh satya is one of the finest film ever made in indian cinema directed by the great director govind nihalani this one is the most successful hard hitting parallel cinema which also turned out to be a commercial success even today ardh satya is an inspiration for all leading directors of india br br the film tells the real-life scenario of mumbai police of the 70s unlike any police of other cities in india mumbai police encompasses a different system altogether govind nihalani creates a very practical outlay with real life approach of mumbai police environment br br amongst various police officers colleagues the film describes the story of anand velankar a young hot-blooded cop coming from a poor family his father is a harsh police constable anand himself suffers from his father's ideologies incidences of his father's atrocities on his mother anand's approach towards immediate action against crime is an inert craving for his own job satisfaction the film is here revolved in a plot wherein anand's constant efforts against crime are trampled by his seniors this leads to frustrations as he cannot achieve the desired job-satisfaction resulting from the frustrations his anger is expressed in excessive violence in the remand rooms bars also turning him to an alcoholic br br the spirit within him is still alive as he constantly fights the system he is aware of the system of the metro where the police politicians are a inertly associated by far end his compromise towards unethical practice is negative finally he gets suspended br br the direction is a master piece thoroughly hard core one of the best memorable scenes is when anand breaks in the underworld gangster rama shetty's house to arrest him followed by short conversation which is fantastic at many scenes the film has hair-raising moments br br the practical approach of script is a major punch alcoholism corruption political influence courage deceptions all are integral part of mumbai police even today those aspects are dealt brilliantly br br finally the films belongs to the one man show om puri portraying anand velankar traversing through all his emotions absolutely brilliantly 
an absolute classic the direction is flawless the acting is just superb words fall short for this great work the most definitive movie on mumbai police this movie has stood the test of times br br om puri gives a stellar performance smita patil no less all the actors have done their best and the movie races on thrilling you at every moment this movie shakes your whole being badly and forces you to rethink about many issues that confront our society br br this is the story of a cop om puri who starts out in his career as a honest man but ultimately degenerates into a killer the first attempt in bollywood to get behind the scenes and expose the depressing truth about mumbai cops kudos to nihalani br br after this movie a slew of bollywood movies got released that exposed the criminal-politician police nexus thus this movie was truly a trend setter this trend dominated the hindi movie scene for more than a decade br br this movie was a moderate box office hit br br a must-see for discerning movie fans 
govind nihalani's directorial venture of vijay tendulkar's novel is brilliant om puri plays an inspector velankar who is forced to protect underworld don rama shetty played brilliantly by sadahiv amrapurkar this is govind nihlan's most talked about movie this is a very good and a classic film smita patil plays the female lead opposite om puri naseeruddin shah is brilliant in a cameo role although sadashiv amrapurkar has only 4 scenes in the movie he dominates the movie this was sadashiv amrapurkars acting debut om puri won a national award for this film for the best actor filmfare award winner for best film story supporting actor sadashiv amrapurkar 
i love this show br br every time i watch an episode i repeat that line and remind myself how good of a show this is i am a huge sci-fi fan and this show has grounds to be the most important science fiction show in the history of film tv there are so many theories in this show about the universe i could start a religion its amazing season after season the show gets better and better br br i've been a fan of macgyver since i was 5 19 now and i find it so ironic that my 2 favorite tv shows of all time star richard dean anderson its also interesting how each character is practically the opposite of the other br br back when i first saw stargate the movie i instantly liked it and considered it one of my favorite sci-fi flicks then hearing a tv show would spin from it i got really excited but didn't get showtime till the fifth season was almost over br br though i'm disappointed to hear that roland emmerich and dean devlin wanted to do a trilogy of movies but the studio optioned the series instead br br id say though that it turned out just fine maybe even better br br this show is amazing and i hope it never dies atlantis here we come 
any story comprises a premise characters and conflict characters plotting their own play promises triumph and a militant character readily lends oneself to this ardh satya's premise is summarized by the poem of the same name scripted by dilip chitre the line goes ek palde mein napunsaktha doosre palde mein paurush aur teek tarazu ke kaante par ardh satya a rough translation the delicate balance of right wrong commonly seen on the busts of blind justice in the courts has powerlessness on one plate and prowess on another is the needle on the center a half-truth br br the poem is recited midway in the film by smita patil to om puri at a resturant it makes a deep impact on the protagonist lays the foundation for much of the later events that follow at the end of the film om puri ends up in exactly the same situation described so aptly in the poem br br the film tries mighty hard to do a one-up on the poem however chitre's words are too powerful and at best the film matches up to the poem in every aspect br br 
the haunted world of edward d wood jr isn't a particularly good documentary aesthetically it's lackluster and cheap looking the people in it go off on tangents which make it very unfocused and in-cohesive but this adds to it's charm i say this because it's a documentary about an oddball that made oddball pictures and surrounded himself with fellow oddballs and as such there's really no other way to document the life and career of the man and his crew of misfits there are some glimpses of insight into both the genius and the ineptness of wood and the portrayal of both qualities is a credit to the genuineness of the documentary overall it's worth a watch for the wood fan and those of cinema in general but don't expect brilliance here expect a documentary made after wood's own heart 
i originally caught this back in 1996 in its one week run at a movie theatre i was under impressed by it and my feelings haven't much changed br br documentary about the infamous edward d wood jr covering his life and movies there are interviews with people who worked with him or knew him they include vampira dolores fuller bela lugosi jr loretta king gregory walcott and paul marco interviews are mixed with clips from the movies or some bizarre recreations it is interesting somewhat but was this really needed i've seen all of wood's films and they're just terrible wood had ambitions but not a bit of talent to carry them out i wouldn't say he was the worst director ever but he's down there do we really need a docu on a very mediocre film maker i do like the fact that they didn't try to make wood out to be some sort of saint more than a few of those interviewed especially lugosi jr pretty much hated the man and it comes through loud and clear also they totally ignore his films in the adult film industry in the 1960s and 70s still it's of interest if you're a wood fan the best interviews are with vampira who tears wood apart and dolores fuller a long time girlfriend 
i loved this film not being a swooning ed wood jr fan i prefer to appreciate his boundless enthusiasm and acknowledge his shortcomings his movies are fun but his personal story is one racked with pain i hoped and was delighted to find that this film would be about understanding his turbulent life rather than simply heaping him with posthumous praise from beginning to end this film evolves from a documentary into a mythology leaving the cast and the viewer unexpectedly connected to each other and to ed wood jr br br what we get are people who knew ed wood the best talking about him from all perspectives positive and negative and showing us their character as much as ed's we get insight into ed's personal and professional life from his romances to his drinking to his sexuality to his friends to his enemies and even to his film making br br the film itself is shot in a low-budget way that seems done out of respect for ed as if using the techniques of most theatrically released movies from 1996 would be disrespectful sort of like wearing a nicer suit than the president the set designer uses a sense of humor and also a great deal of insight when matching each cast member with their background br br fans will be excited to hear personal testimony regarding ed wood controversies and new comers will be amazed that this man was real the dvd is full of impossible to find gems crossroads of lorado and photo galleries but the real treasure of this film is the surprisingly engaging and interconnected story br br ed wood had a habit of defining people through their association with him for better or worse to the point where one woman will go down in history as swimming pool owner for once letting him and his friends be baptized in her pool this ability to define a person's legacy comes through universally as the most amazing effect of the film is to not only give a well rounded idea of the man that was ed wood jr but also to give a comprehensive view of the community that he created somehow without ever having more that one cast member being interviewed on screen at a time the connection that ed wood created amongst the various people in his life becomes clear and the viewer is left with great sense of involvement br br even the title hints at the b-list horror genre but by the end we see that even this is a kindness what begins as unrelated stories by random people ends with the conclusion that all of the cast will be forever weaved into an unpredictably cohesive fabric that history will bring into haunting unity with wood's legend br br in many ways a living contradiction ed wood jr could not be condensed to a single viewpoint this collaborative effort is the closest to knowing him that we can ever get being itself a juxtaposition of themes it is at once respectful provocative thoughtful gripping fun sad kind and fulfilling 
the haunted world of edward d wood jr is the definitive documentary on the life of the man who brought us such movies as glen or glenda bride of the monster and of course plan 9 from outer space this exquisite film far exceeds where other documentaries such as look back in angora and the plan 9 companion failed it rounds up his surviving entourage many of whom have passed away since filming and gives an honest examination of ed wood and his work nostalgic in the fact that it looks back at the darker corner of yesteryear hollywood sentimental in its treatment of the director down to the haunting music this documentary is an absolute must-see for anyone who loves the director who so failed in his day the entire two hours of the film lovingly and retrospectively pieces together ed's life and untimely death for the viewer best watched at 3 am while wearing an angora sweater 
this film deals with the atrocity in derry 30 years ago which is commonly known as bloody sunday br br the film is well researched acted and directed it is as close to the truth as we will get until the outcome of the saville enquiry the film puts the atrocity into context of the time it also shows the savagery of the soldiers on the day of the atrocity the disgraceful white-wash that was the widgery tribunal is also dealt with br br overall this is an excellent drama which is moving and shocking when the saville report comes out watch this film again to see how close to the truth it is 
an excellent and accurate film mcgovern takes great pains to research and document his writing and it pays off he is not afraid to tell the truth even though it might draw unfavourable reviews and comments from some who like stories to be clean and sweet and glossy br br once again mcgovern brings in christopher eccleston though not in as high a profile a role as he played in hillsborough i found this movie as accurate well acted and well presented as hillsborough and i applaud mcgovern for his poignant unapologetic writing well done and my hat is off to the writer the actors the production crew a great film 
the story of a drifter his sheep ranch boss and the boss's daughter is not for all tastes but it's still very intriguing it takes place in the beautiful country of new zealand amongst the scenery we've come to know so well through other films from this region br br this movie was the first time i had ever seen the excellent mary regan and i've been a fan of hers ever since the cast also contains bruno lawrence who is probably best remembered by american audiences from the film smash palace terence cooper takes a turn as the ranch owner who pays a little too much of the wrong sort of attention to his daughter regan br br sharply acted with unforgettably shattering performances from all of its leads i first saw this movie in extremely edited form on late night television here in america but believe you me the unexpurgated version is not to be missed 
i really like miikes movies about yakuza this one i saw about 2 years ago and it really fu ed my head never before seen such a sick and twisted thing the story is good and the actors do their thing very well i haven't seen the uk or japan version but i have to say that i believe that the german dvd is a bit censored if you haven't seen the movie already and live in germany maybe you better look out for a dvd from the nederlands or austria the i-on dvd contains a lot of very hard and nasty scenes but at the showdown i felt that something was missing about one or two very short scenes br br all in all a good perverted movie with crazy characters and a high level of violence that's what i like miike for 
anyone new to the incredibly prolific takashi miike's work might want to think twice about making this startling film their first experience of this truly maverick director in keeping with miike's working practice of taking any work that comes his way and then grafting his own sensibilities onto the script this is at heart a fairly basic yakuza thriller with a morally ambiguous cop chasing a gang which his lawyer brother has fallen in with what takes the movie out of the realms of the same-old same-old however is the utterly unflinching attitude so some of the most sudden and horrific violence seen in today's cinema and this isn't that nice cool clean violence so beloved of us cinema this stuff is nasty painful and hurts that said the pace is breakneck the characters are unusual without being just being burdened with stock eccentricities miike's sense of humour reveals itself and the most unexpected moments and his camera is never quite where you expect it to be making it hard to look away from the screen whatever he might be showing you it doesn't have the ohmigod ending of dead or alive but if you're not squeamish now's the time to get on board the miike bandwagon before he ends up on some hollywood studio's new john woo shopping list 
i love jack's jokes like the clich is or over the top clich guy black oily skin kinda spooky he is just hilarious daniel's starting to catch up on him to good thing jack's not on the team anymore in a way or else it would have been sarcasm mania i just love all the plots season 8 a little less i have to admit the characters are great the actors are great i'm starting to pick up facial expressions and more from jack daniel and teal'c it just all theoretically possible and exciting oops their i go again sorry i'm also starting to pick up traits from carter and all of this is driving my parents nutz well to conclude i think it's good for another three seasons or so especially if they keep on packing the episodes with all this humor drama action and so forth 
the movie starts something like a less hyper-kinetic more pastiche dead or alive strange underground activities are done while bodies are discovered by police officers but when a police officer is killed one tatsuhito gets involved and when he discovers that his brother shihito is also involved things get bloody quite fast br br an earlier work of miike's shinjuku triad society is still filled with his usual in the ol ultraviolence and sadistic sex acts though it's not one of his more eclectic or flamboyant pieces rather it's a pretty well crafted bit of pulp fiction as tatsuhito digs his way through the underground a maze that leads him to a gay triad leader who sells illegally gained body organs from taiwan and keeps an almost-brothel of young boys one in particular the character who kills the cop at the beginning tatsuhito's brother is getting involved with said society so tatsuhito himself is forced to become a dirty cop and use similarly violent and sadistic tactics to penetrate into this sordid realm br br what's mainly interesting about this little bit of work is the relationship tatsuhito has with his nemesis wang tatsuhito is a japanese born in china later moved back into japan and alienated for it wang is a chinese who felt alienated in china so killed his father and developed a crime wing in japan wang also is a surprisingly shakespearian character which is weird enough as it is much less that you actually begin to feel sorry for him by the time his ultimate showdown with tatsuhito comes to be and tatsuhito himself is a similarly tragic figure when he's forced to contend with his lack of ability to control his brother while it would be rude to state that miike's movies are successful mostly on their shock value it is true that sometimes it's easy to lose track of how well miike can create bitter dis-impassioned characters br br polarisdib 
while not as wild and way out as some of takashi miike's later films this is a very good crime drama br br the basic story is the story of a cop of japanese cop with chinese parents trying to take down an up and coming chinese mobster complicating things is that his younger brother is acting as the lawyer for the villain and his gang the film is actually much more complicated than that with several complications which both keep things interesting and distract things from the central narrative thrust its this complication and loss of way about an hour into the film that makes this less than a great film it is a very very good one this is definitely worth seeing especially if you don't mind a no frantic pace br br a word of warning the violence when it happens is explosive and nasty there are also semi-graphic depictions of gay sex if thats not your cup of tea proceed with caution br br 7 or 8 out of 10 
i found this a bit hard to follow to the extent that it seemed to dip in the middle while i tried to make head or tail of who was fighting who and why one of the problems is the cultural language one here we have a chinese taiwanese japanese problem of which we know little and because we are simply reading english subtitles inevitably loose some of the subtleties another problem is that there seem to be just too many only half explained twists and coincidences nevertheless it seems unlikely that there is a wholly bad miiki film and this certainly is not that plenty of stylish and bone crunching violence a window upon some less than orthodox sexual goings on plus the family aspect all in all a decent ride but maybe checking out the storyline might actually be helpful before watching this one 
shinjuku triad society chinese mafia wars is unlikely to get distribution in the west outside film festivals why could your censors stomach a film where policemen anally rape male and female suspects to get them to talk and the victims enjoy it or see an old lady have her eye torn out of her skull these are just a few of the shocks in store for viewers of this ultraviolent cops and gangsters story it makes clockwork orange which was banned for years in the uk look like a disney cartoon br br should you see this film yes it is fantastic and essential viewing for fans of asian cinema the shocking moments are there to illustrate what goers on in the world of these characters if you like this make sure you catch dead or alive which is very similar barring the insane ending in doa of course great for japan that they have a talent like miike working at the same time as takeshi kitano the best chance of seeing this film outside a takashi miike retrospective at a film festival is on dvd if i haven't put you off try hunting for a hong kong version on the web as i'm sure it will come out in that country 
shinjuku triad society albeit from perfect is a fiercely compelling film for what it tries to depict in its uber-conventional realm it's a yakuza triad picture involving cops versus japanese or chinese gangsters mostly chinese as the title suggests but already even in his first technical debut takashi miike is already establishing many aspects to films that he would make from here-on in social issues like black market trading of precious goods in this case human organs usually from children nostalgia for childhood and one's roots which was especially prevalent in dead or alive 2 thumbing-of the-nose at taboos like gay sex and satirical rape violence towards women blood-curdling violence it's certainly not as surreal as some of miike's most recent films but this is expected as he's trying out things that he's just starting to learn following a track record of straight to video programmers it's got all of those qualities and it's also like the films that would follow from it equally savage and heartfelt crazy in spots and sardonic in its drama and solid for genre fans br br the story concerns two brothers one a chinese orphan raised in japan tatsuhito kiriya kippei shiina pretty decent as a eastwood-esquire anti-hero hero who's become a detective and another who's become a gangster or a would-be one the main arch likely takeover gang comes from wang a definite pun on what the gang represents during its spare-time played by tomorowo taguchi as a typical wacko with real terror in his eyes and his partner karino takeshi caesar who's threatening even when just repeating a commandment over and over to a woman who's just had her eye plugged out following a sour deal who are the ruthless kind to pop up almost organically in a miike movie there's some intrigue involving the organ-trading scheme with the gangsters which kiriya almost becomes a victim of and the gang's penchant for gay sex at least with one little puppet of sorts who does whatever the main gangsters want it all leads up to vengeance and redemption qualities that miike and his writer are trying to emulate from shakespeare hence the macbeth bit with wang washing his bloody hangs over and over after some gay sex saying it won't come off br br if it doesn't add up to the same emotional level of impact that a great shakespeare play would have it's par for the course of a film like this miike's goals are met though just met in his low-scale ambitions a gangster picture with some added levels of harsh familial trouble the main tension between the brothers comes out of profession and duty to parents notes on the crueler aspects of underworld crime and what the realm of unrepentant sex with both sexes brings out psychologically in the characters at the same time shinjuku triad society also contains more than a few moments of classic biting black-comedy from the miike oeuvre some of it just has to be taken with a grain of salt for what the director does in his outrageousness like the bit at the beginning with the chair smashing over the face or the randomness of the interrogation as it goes into a very twisted area there's even a laugh-out loud line from the young sex-slave after finishing an act on one of the bosses thank you mr weeny-burger miike and his writer don't have enough here to make the film a full-on dark comedy like ichi or of course visitor q but there's enough to bring some appropriate levity to the darker aspects to the story and characters br br as the first entry of the black society trilogy as it's called i was quite impressed and it's a fine quasi-calling card from one of the craziest new artists in contemporary cinema 
this movie is the first of miikes triad society trilogy and the trilogy kicks of to a great start the movies in the trilogy are only connected thematically and these themes are actually apparent in all his films if you look close enough shinjuku triad society is about a cop trying to prevent his kid brother from getting too involved with a rather extreme gang of outsiders struggling their way to the top of tokyos yakuza the kid brother is a lawyer and the triad gang is becoming increasingly in need of one as the movie progresses the movie takes place in a very harsh environment and is therefore pretty violent and tough miike has done worse but since this is a serious movie it hits you very hard as usual there is also a lot of perverted sex mostly homosexual in this one the movie is in many ways a typical gangster movie but with a great drive and true grittiness if you've only seen miikes far-out movies ichi the killer fudoh etc this is worth checking out since it is sort of a compromise between his aggressive over-the top style displayed in those movies and his more serious side as seen in the other films of the trilogy and as always with miike there are at least two scenes in this that you'll never forget see it and figure out which ones for yourself br br 8 10 
a lot has been said about shinjuku triad society as the first true miike film and i thought this sort of description might have been a clich but like all clich s it is based on the truth all the miike trademarks are here the violence the black humour the homosexuality the taboo testing and the difficult to like central character shinjuku is however one of miike's most perfectly formed films he says in an interview that if he made it again it would be different but not necessarily better i think what he means is that the film possesses a truly captivating energy and raw edge which seems so fresh that although he might be able to capture a more visually or technically complex movie he could not replicate or better the purity of this film br br as you might expect the violence is utterly visceral gushing blood and gritty beatings are supplemented by a fantastic scene in which a woman has a chair smashed over her face only a miike film could let you get away with a sentence like that the film has a fantastic pace unlike dead or alive which begins and ends strongly and dips in the middle dead or alive also deals with similar issues miike is clearly concerned about the relations between the japanese and chinese in the postwar period and this emotive subject is handled well here the central character really coming to life when you begin to understand his past br br i cannot sing shinjuku's praises enough i do not want to give away too much this is miike before he began to use cgi to animate his films and is almost reminiscent of something like kitano's sonatine the central characters are superbly realized and the final twist guarantees that as soon as the film has finished you'll be popping it back on again to work it all out 
this was the beginning of it all granted this is not friends at its best but this was the show's pilot let's not forget and not a bad one at that we're introduced to the gang and central perk where our story begins even from this first episode we get a sign of the ross-rachel relationship that will come over the next ten years when ross says i just want to be married again and rachel storms in with a wedding dress on probably not intentional as at the time the writers were going for a monica-joey relationship but fits nicely now when looking back something else in this episode rachel is introduced to chandler as if the two have never met before but in later episodes the so-called flashbacks this is contradicted as the two have met on three previous occasions nevertheless the point is this a fine start to a great show this episode may not be the usual friends as we are accustomed to them with the cast still a bit inexperienced but over the next few episodes we see why the show came to be what it was keep watching first season is a blast 
here it is the first ever episode of friends where we get introduced to control freak monica gellar courtney cox newly divorced ross gellar david schimmer hippy pheobe buffay lisa kudrow unknown actor and ladies man matt le blanc and very sarcastic chandler bing matthew perry this is how the scene starts off until we introduced to the 6th and final friend spoilt kid rachel green jennifer aniston br br the episode is better than most people give credit for like any new sitcom the first episode isn't always fantastic the acting in this episode isn't great because the cast cannot identify and arnt really believable in their new characters apart from kudrow and perry who shine br br matt le blanc man his acting was down right dreadful because until later he gets more confident but i think he tries to be funny but at most fails br br david schimmer why does he over pronounce every word he cannot speak normally but he became one of the funniest characters in later seasons but he isn't confident and i cannot sympathise with him jennifer aniston looks hot and does a good job as rachel green but we only see the real rachel later in the 1st season courtney cox looks quite anorexic in this episode its worrying she looks totally different now more healthily she acting is a little sketchy but everyones is in this 20 minute pilot lisa kudrow and matthew perry i'm doing these two together because their comic timing and acting quality was superb and for lisa this was one of her first roles and she is so natural as pheobe pheebs and matthew perry is just matthew perry playing himself basically the episode quality does improve later such as the sets they looks dark and creepy in this episode and makes them seem unfriendly the acting is ok the characters gain confidence with each new scene and i am proud this is the pilot i hope we see the friends reunite cause they will always be there for us

stargate sg-1 is a spin off of sorts from the 1994 movie stargate i am so glad that they decided to expand on the subject the show gets it rolling from the very first episode a retired jack o'neill has to go through the gate once more to meet with his old companion dr daniel jackson through the first two episodes we meet samantha carter a very intelligent individual who lets no one walk over her and there is teal'c a quiet compassionate warrior who defies his false god and joins the team br br the main bad guys are called the gouald they are parasites who can get inserted into one's brain thus controlling them and doing evil deeds any gouald who has a massive amount of power is often deemed as a system lord the warriors behind the gouald are called jaffa who house the parasitic gouald in their bodies until the gouald can get inserted in a person's brain br br through the episodes we mostly get to see sg-1 the exploratory team comprised of jack daniel teal'c and sam go through the wormhole that instantly transports them to other planets this device is called the stargate and they encounter new cultures or bad guys some episodes are on-world meaning that they do not go through the stargate once in the episode and rather deal with pressing issues on earth br br through the years you start to see a decline in the sg-1 team as close knit and more character-building story lines this in turn means even more on-world episodes which is perfectly understandable br br my rating 8 75 10 while most of this show is good there are some instances of story lines not always getting wrapped up and less of an emphasis on gate travel these last few years but still top notch science fiction 
the pilot is extremely well done it lays out how the characters bond in future episodes i don't think anyone could have created a better pilot for this show it displays remarkable creativity on the writers part although not everything was straightened out because it was the very first episode a lot of events that happen in future seasons were demonstrated in the pilot an example would be ross and rachels future relationship even though the nervousness of a first episode appeared it was overcome by an amazing plot and outstanding cast choice br br bravo br br a great start to an unbeatable comedy 
in the very first episode of friends which aired 22 sept 1994 the one where monica gets a roommate there is a song playing as rachel sits in the window towards the end of the show the line that plays is if you ever need holding does anyone know the artist singing or the title of the song it is seems as if it is a great song i would love to get a copy of it thanks for the assistance i am looking for the album cd it is on so i can purchase it br br i have the shows which are available for purchase and enjoy this show over and over again it just seemed to be believable thanks for the hours of entertainment you have provided over the years 
in this first episode of friends we are introduced to the 6 main characters of the series monica geller phoebe buffay chandler bing ross geller joey tribbiani and eventually rachel green br br we discover that rachel a rich girl that is monica's friend from high school times left her fianc barry at the altar since she discovered she didn't love him she also decides to live with monica and become independent from her father getting a new job as a waitress in central perk br br ross for the other hand discovered his wife is a lesbian and lost her for susan her partner we see him moving to a new apartment during the episode br br monica in this episode makes out and eventually sleeps with paul the wine guy who gave her the excuse of being impotent since he divorced his wife but in reality he was just deceiving her br br ps i just loooove joey's and chandler's haircuts in this first season 
why did it sound like the husband kept calling her appy it ruined a great episode and so i can only give it a 6 proper grammar and pronunciation are essential to a film br br it was very hellraiser what with all the skin ripping though i dunno how anyone can survive without skin the skin is a vital organ to the body the biggest organ actually and without we would die the more a horror film is true the more creepy it can be and more entertaining br br i do admit though that the stories from the great horror directors are very disappointing and very mediocre br br 6 10 come on yankies get your english up to par 
masters of horror right to die starts late one night as married couple abby julia anderson ciff addison martin donovan are driving home however while talking cliff is distracted crashes into a tree that has fallen across the road cliff's airbag works ok he walks away with minor injuries unfortunately for abby hers didn't she ended up as toast when she was thrown from the car doused in petrol which set alight burning her entire body abby's life is saved just she is taken to hospital where she is on life support seriously injured horribly disfigured from the burns cliff decides that she should die his selfish lawyer ira corbin bersen thinks they should let abby die sue the car manufacturer get rich while abby's mum pam linda sorenson wants to blame cliff get rich save abby however abby has other plans of her own br br this american canadian co-production was directed by rob schmidt whose only horror film previously was wrong turn 2003 which on it's own hardly qualifies him to direct a masters of horror episode was episode 9 from season 2 of the masters of horror tv series while i didn't think right to die was the best masters of horror episode i've seen i thought it was a decent enough effort all the same still doesn't come close to being as bad as the screwfly solution 2006 the script by john esposito has a neat central idea that isn't anything new but it uses it effectively enough although i'd say it's a bit uneven the first 15 minutes of this focuses on the horror element of the story but then it goes into a lull for 20 odd minutes as it becomes a drama as the legal wrangling over abby's life the affair cliff is having take center stage before it gets back on track it a deliciously gory twisted climax that may not be for the faint of heart the character's are a bit clich d the weak man the bent lawyer the protective mum the young tart who has sex to get what she wants but they all serve their purpose well enough the dialogue is ok the story moves along at a nice pace overall i liked right to die apart from a few minutes here there where it loses it's focus a bit i wasn't that keen on the ambiguous ending br br director schmidt does a good job there are some effective scenes this tries to alternate between low key spooky atmosphere out-and out blood gore there are some fantastic special make-up effects as usual there's shots of abby where she has had all of the skin burned off her body the image of her bandaged head with her teeth showing because she has no lips left is pretty gross images make-up effects that reminded me of similar scenes in hellraiser 1987 it's sequels then there's the main course at the end where cliff literally skins someone complete with close-ups of scalpels slicing skin open him peeling it off the muscle putting it into a cooler box very messy there are also various assorted body parts there's some nudity here as well with at least a couple of pretty ladies getting naked br br technically right to die is excellent the special effects are brilliant as most masters of horror episodes it doesn't look like a cheap made-for tv show which basically if the truth be told it is the acting was fine but there's no big names in this one br br right to die is another enjoyable somewhat twisted masters of horror episode that most horror fans should definitely check out if not just for the terrific skinning scene well worth a watch for those with the stomach 
what starts out as a very predictable and somewhat drab affair is in the end quite hilarious and entertaining right to die is not very suspenseful but it more than makes up for that with some outlandish set pieces and over the top gore br br spoilers here br br top credits also go to the dead-on performance from martin donovan as one of the most despicable characters ever to grace the screen playing the character in a great aloof fashion you nearly feel bad for the guy in the end when his grand plan ultimately fails corbin bernsen also chews up the scenery playing a not-so good-guy who gets his just desserts br br end of spoiler br br as a revenge-from the-dead flick right to die benefits heavily from it's performers and is more than an ok way to spend less than an hour 
this is one of the best episode from the second season of moh i think mick garris has a problem with women he kill'em all they are often the victims screwfly solution pro-life valerie on the stairs i don't remember the argento's episode in season 1 etc obviously imprint i think he enjoys to watch women been burn torture mutilated and i don't know never least right to die is one of the best with good turns and graphic scenes and suspense specially with the photos from the cell scene wonderful the acting is like the entire series regular i could be worst like pro-life or we scream for ice cream also i think the plot it could be made for a movie and not just for an episode the ideology of the series is horrible killing and terminating women mutilating animals and on and on the first season it was better than the second one with episodes like cigarrette burns the best of all homecoming the most funny imprint really shocking 
i'm not entirely sure rob schmidt qualifies as a master in the genre of horror since he previously just directed one horror film called wrong turn and that one was actually just was slightly above mediocre but fact is that he made with right to die one of the best and creepiest episodes of the entire second season of the masters of horror franchise there was a similar underdog story in season one when william malone made on of the best episodes with the fair haired child even though his other long feature films fear dot com and house on haunted hill sucked pretty badly br br the story of right to die cleverly picks in on the nowadays piping hot social debate of euthanasia but thankfully also features multiple old-fashioned horror themes like ghostly vengeance murderous conspiracies pitch black humor and comic book styled violence whilst driving home late one night and discussing the husband's continuous adultery the addison couple are involved in a terrible car accident cliff walks away from the wreck unharmed but his wife abby is fully burned and needs to be kept alive artificially whilst cliff and his sleazy attorney corbin bernsen of the dentist want to plug the plug on her and sue the car constructor abbey's mum sets up a giant media campaign to keep her daughter alive as a vegetable and blame everything on cliff meanwhile abbey's hateful spirit comes back for revenge and kills someone in cliff's surrounding whenever she has a near fatal experience with the medical devices after a few victims cliff realizes it might be safer for him to keep his wife alive if he wants to remain alive as well right to die is a stupendous episode and exactly the type of stuff i always hoped to see from a tv-series concept like masters of horror it's violent and gory with a sick twisted sense of humor and loads of sleaze sequences the euthanasia theme and the whole obligatory media circus that surrounds it is processed into the script very well yet without unnecessarily reverting to political standpoints or morality lessons the atmosphere is suspenseful and the killing sequences are suitably nasty and unsettling actresses julia anderson and robin sydney both have pretty face and impressively voluptuous racks which is always a welcome plus and corbin bernsen is finally offered the chance again to depict a mean-spirited and egocentric bastard great moh episode definitely one of the highlights of both seasons 
well its about time i had really given up any and all hope that there was going to be a standout episode among this season's entries while there have still been far too many drab to hohum entries at least this episode turned out well its rather funny that director rob schmidt who only has the not bad wrong turn to his credit and writer john esposito whose only scripting chores to date have included tale of the mummy and graveyard shift should be the ones to give us the best written and most thought provoking episode of the season in right to die we are treated to the story of cliff and abbey at the start of the episode the couple are having a conversation abbey has caught cliff cheating and he is desperately trying to win her back while they speak they find themselves in a car accident where cliff is left with only scratches and bruises but abbey is thrown from the car and catches on fire when a spark ignites and gasoline that had dripped onto her catches her on fire and this is just the setup people once in the hospital cliff must decide whether or not abbey should live in this state with no skin and only nerve reflexes there's also a side effect too every time she flatlines abbey goes a walking as a ghost and causes trouble for all sorts of people hands down this is the best episode of the season and certainly ranks as one of the top episodes ever from the gruesome effects to the taut script which threw in a few twists i never saw coming and suspense so palpable you can almost touch it right to die should have the right to go on living forever 
a man and his wife get in a horrible car accident when the wife is left in a persistent vegetative state the man must choose between pulling the plug and letting her live the decision is made even harder when he realizes her ghost wants to extract revenge on him and those around him br br this comes to us from director rob schmidt who made wrong turn a film i have not seen with only one horror film under his belt and not a particularly notorious one at that i was a bit reluctant to watch this episode expecting schmidt to be a master of horror in only the most liberal sense my apologies to him for my underestimation as of episode 10 in a 13 episode season this was actually the best one yet br br the issue of the right to die is dealt with and covered in enough detail to be a solid plot device however this is only the foundation on which the story revolves once the horror elements show up the film goes from decent to spectacular great acting great plot great dialogue great suspense i was a little creeped out at times which is good and most of all the gore is in extreme abundance i read a review of this episode prior to watching it where the reviewer said there is a strong hint of hellraiser in this through the first part of the show i had no idea what they were talking about then there is a bit later where some images do remind me of hellraiser 2 however i in no way wish to say that this takes away from the film i can see no other way to create the effect that was created and in my opinion this looks remarkably better than hellraiser 2 br br some plot twists show up later on and might invite the viewer to give the film a second look i didn't watch it a second time but i think the beginning would make more sense if i had not that it's confusing the subplot with the dental hygienist is also nice and i found myself going back and forth about whether i disliked the main character for his relationship with her or if i felt bad for him he's somewhat of an anti-hero to the whole story if you will i feel inclined to cheer for him as the protagonist but he's completely unlovable br br while the stuart gordon episode may be better and i'm excited about the washingtonians episode i think i could safely bet that this is the key episode of the season and by far the saving grace of what was otherwise lackluster and routine when legends like john carpenter let me down again i get a bit worried about the genre's future but then a fresh face like rob schmidt comes along and gives me hope this one is a keeper and please bring schmidt back for season 3 
stargate sg-1 follows and expands upon the egyptian mythologies presented in stargate in the stargate universe humans were enslaved and transported to habitable planets by the goa'uld such as ra and apophis for millennia the goa'uld harvested humanity heavily influencing and spreading human cultures as a result earth cultures such as those of the aztecs mayans britons the norse mongols greeks and romans are found throughout the known habitable planets of the galaxy many well-known mythical locations such as avalon camelot and atlantis are found or have at one time existed br br presently the earth stargate found at a dig site near giza in 1928 is housed in a top-secret u s military base known as the sgc stargate command underneath cheyenne mountain col jack o'neill anderson dr daniel jackson shanks capt samantha carter tapping and teal'c judge compose the original sg-1 team a few characters join and or leave the team in later seasons along with 24 other sg teams they venture to distant planets exploring the galaxy and searching for defenses from the goa'uld in the forms of technology and alliances with friendly advanced races br br the parasitic goa'uld use advanced technology to cast themselves as egyptian gods and are bent on galactic conquest and eternal worship throughout the first eight seasons the goa'uld are the primary antagonists they are a race of highly intelligent ruthless snake-like alien parasites capable of invading and controlling the bodies of other species including humans the original arch-enemy from this race was the system lord apophis peter williams other system lords such as baal and anubis play pivotal roles in the later seasons in the ninth season a new villain emerges the ori the ori are advanced beings with unfathomable technology from another galaxy also bent on galactic conquest and eternal worship the introduction of the ori accompanies a departure from the primary focus on egyptian mythology into an exploration of the arthurian mythology surrounding the ori their followers and their enemies the ancients 
fans of the hbo series tales from the crypt are going to love this moh episode those who know the basic archetypal stories that most of the classic ec comics were based on will recognize this one right off the bat br br underrated indie favorite martin donovan also an excellent writer co-author of the screenplays for apartment zero and death becomes her is the kind of guy whose everyman good looks can go either way he could play a really nice if misunderstood guy-next door or he can play the same role with a creepy undertone of corrosive sleaziness in the case of right to die he takes the latter approach and it definitely works br br donovan is a doctor who has recently had an affair with his slutty office receptionist robin sydney much to the displeasure of his inconsolable unforgiving spouse abbey julia anderson when the two of them get involved in a terrible car accident while returning from an unsuccessful weekend of making up and she's horribly burned in a fire he's reluctant to pull the plug on her not without some enthusiastic nudging from his even sleazier lawyer and best buddy corbin bernsen looking the worse for wear these days br br but abbey's never been one to give up without a fight and that's where the ec-theme of the episode comes in cuckolded husbands and wives have always been the genre's favorite subject matter for some spooky and ooky supernatural shenanigans and this case is definitely no exception if anything the ramped-up quotient of sex and gore must have bill gaines cackling with glee in his mausoleum somewhere br br and that's not to mention that john esposito's original script does give the adultery angle just a slight twist you don't realize as you're watching that you only know half the story until close to the end think what lies beneath with more guts and gazongas and you're there br br not a bad effort but not the best of the lot either at least rob schmidt does display touches of flair here and there with the direction especially in a scene that makes cell phone picture messaging into a truly horrifying experience indeed as with most moh episodes this one is following a prevalent theme this season of flaying and dismemberment so the extremely squeamish need not apply 
i was all ready to pan this episode seeing that this master really doesn't have any horror films under his belt but this is easily the best episode of the season br br the acting was good i don't know how he wrangled it but we've got some real talent in this episode and while you could see things coming from a mile away plot wise at least it was entertaining and managed to keep me engaged for the full 56 mins something that has been lacking up to this point in the series br br i especially liked the bit at the end not a twist per say but just a funny little bit where he becomes as ever the hen-pecked hubby br br really good effort like i've said in other reviews these are not true masters doing a lot of these episodes but they may someday end up being masters in the future 
maybe it's just because i have an intense fear of hospitals and medical stuff but this one got under my skin pardon the pun this piece is brave not afraid to go over the top and as satisfying as they come in terms of revenge movies not only did i find myself feeling lots of hatred for the screwer and lots of sympathy towards the screwee i felt myself cringe and feel pangs of disgust at certain junctures which is really a rare and delightful thing for a somewhat jaded horror viewer like myself some parts are very reminiscant of hellraiser but come off as tribute rather than imitation it's a heavy handed piece that does not offer the viewer much to consider but i enjoy being assaulted by a film once and awhile this piece brings it and doesn't appologize i liked this one a lot do not watch whilst eating pudding 
this was a superb episode one of the best of both seasons down right horror for a change with a story that is way way above the average moh episodes if there is such a thing a man's wife is almost burned to death in a tragic car wreck in which he was driving his airbag worked her's didn't she is burned beyond recognition great makeup btw and not given much of a chance to live without a full skin graft but even in a coma she keeps dying but brought back by modern technology and when she does die for a few minutes her ghost appears as a very vengeful spirit carnage of course ensues and also some extremely gory killings and also some extremely sexy scenes what more could you ask for you might ask well not much because this baby has it all and a very satirical ending that should leave a smile on most viewers faces i just loved rob schmidt's wrong turn direction too he has a great knack for horror excellent episode this is one i'm buying for sure 
but the fun is in the journey br br i found this movie to be extremely enjoyable not only are both leads extremely easy on the eyes the humor from the supporting cast and the jokes actually made me laugh out loud several times br br yes it's predictable and yes it's a clich romantic comedy but the point is that it's a sweet story the message about finding your one true love also rings true in many ways br br the dialog is dead-on and the acting is well done on all parts and over the top for comic effect the bulgari scene is worth it's weight in gold the actress there deserves honorable mention for those that panned it for being predictable if you want a film with twists and turns that keep you guessing then you want a thriller this is a romantic comedy it touched my heart and made me realize that i was lucky enough to find my true love in life and it has been worth every effort along the way br br great date movie great movie for a happy cry 
this is a really old fashion charming movie the locations are great and the situation is one of those old time preston sturgess movies fi you want to watch a movie that doesn't demand much other then to sit back and relax then this is it the acting is good and i really liked michael rispoli he was in rounders too and while you were sleeping the rest of the cast is fun it's just what happens when two people about to get married meet the one that they really love on the weekend that they are planning their own weddings i know sounds kooky but it is and that's what makes it fun to watch it will make your girl friend either hug you or leave you but at least you'll know 
as we all know a romantic comedy is the genre with the ending already known the two leads always have to get together late in the third act i was trying to figure out how this will wrap up and how they will end up together a clue was given right from the start but you'll never realize it until the end it's a simple hook but it works it had to be you cover a lot of the usual ground but takes a fresh spin when ever possible i liked all the ny characters and i loved the locations it's a postcard of ny also it was nice to watch a film and not find anything offensive in it so if you like a good old fashion romantic movie then this is for you 
does anyone know the exact quote about time and love by george ede aka father fitzpatrick in the move it had to be you he was talking to charlie and annna in the church as they were leaving if not i will have to rent the movie this was a great movie i also loved serendipity great love story for the soul br br i met my one true love my soulmate and although i had the experience to meet him when i had least expecting it i wasn't ready for that kind of emotional relationship br br altho we did marry i wasn't mature enough to give as much as i thought i would i got complacent and took his love for granted and he withstood it for 7 years br br he finally left with resentment but we are still hurt and angry in disbelief about the way it turned out i had some very hard lessons to learn and we have now been apart 3 years br br this movie meant a lot because i am still waiting on reconciling with my one and only true love i can now appreciate that distinct feeling inside of me and the quote of father fitzpatrick rang true for me br br i know when he has healed enough to trust me again we will remarry br br don't ever get complacent and take true love for granted it has been the hardest lesson of my life br br also the music in this movie is outstanding and meaningful this movie is deep and spiritually uplifting true love is worth waiting for if it is meant to be it will no matter what it will happen nothing is impossible even when it's the second time around thanks 
i'd have given this film a few stars simply because it was a lifetime presentation actually filmed in the location represented in the story here new york city most on this channel whether set there in rural iowa oregon virginia l a etc are filmed in vancouver ottawa toronto or some other canadian locale br br but if there ever were one deserving the top rating 10 on this site it's this movie certainly not for originality for this story has been done many times in many variations with several very similar to this specific one it's also been done pretty often on the big screen with mega-stars past and present from cary grant james garner harrison ford tom hanks et al and deborah kerr doris day meg ryan and many more i can think of at least 10-12 more just as prominent past to present off the top of my head who could be added now and there are probably many others which could be brought to mind br br not to drone on but my point is that in my opinion this is by far one of the best of this genre i've seen i caught it by chance on a mid-day friday at a time when i had the tv on only because i was taking a couple of hours following a particularly hectic week i'd never run across this flick in the 8 years since it was made and while the two leads have done enough to be known to most they were completely unknown to me the only two actors i knew were phyllis newman anna's mother whom i'd seen in some things from her younger days and michael rispoli henry charlie's best friend who was outstanding as gramma the menacing juice loan tough street guy from rounders br br the chance meeting and coupling between both leads best friends as a sub-story romance with the correlation of their being such to anna and charlie being only revealed to all later is an oft-done plot contrivance within the genre but makes no difference to the enjoyment here in fact it enhances it br br checking some other comments i agree completely with those which are the most positive the primary word describing this film is engaging in caps this adjective describes the performers the characters the chemistry between and among all of the characters in whatever combination presented and all of the supporting and even minor roles br br i love films with a harder edge rounders the escapist schwarzenegger stallone fare goodfellows even the classics like casablanca gone with the wind citizen kane but for pure uncomplicated enjoyment this one was outstanding with a bare fraction of their budgets it was equal to the results achieved by you've got mail and sleepless in seattle and tom hanks and meg ryan couldn't have done better than natasha henstridge and michael vartan here the co-stars and support personnel here were equivalent to those in these mega-films as well 
a sweet funny story of 2 people crossing paths as they prepare for their weddings the ex-cop writer and the public school teacher fall for each other in this great new york setting even though they are marrying other people maybe a little trite in that the partners are both type a personalities while our protagonists are much more relaxed not anything heavy but it made me smile and hey for the guys sell the natasha henstridge angle and the gals sell them the sappy romance everyone wins 
it's amazing that from a good though not wonderful film made back in the early nineties a whole franchise can grow stargate sg1 is without a doubt a worthy addition to the science fiction genre and has the right to stand shoulder-to shoulder with star trek as the kings of sci-fi br br following on from the 1994 feature film stargate this series sees stargate command a military science organisation figuring out that the stargate system can be used to travel to various planets across the galaxy and beyond and the military sets up a number of teams to explore sg1 is one such team headed by military veteran colonel jack o'neill and includes archaeologist doctor daniel jackson military scientist captain samantha carter and alien teal'c who has betrayed his overlord leaders in the hopes of one day freeing his people earth quickly makes an enemy of the goa'uld a parasitic race who use humans as hosts and think themselves equal to gods br br the top-notch cast have much to be congratulated for in bringing this show to life richard dean anderson is perfect as the cynical and sarcastic o'neill who can shift from boyish to deadly in the blink of an eye michael shanks as daniel brings heart and an will of steel to the character who has grown from wide-eyed innocence to darker and more hard-bitten as the show has progressed amanda tapping as carter has perfected the balance between depicting her character's femininity without comprising the fact she is a strong intelligent military scientist christopher judge is excellent as the aloof teal'c who is able to depict the character's emotions with subtlety and don s davis is perfect as the esteemed general hammond who leads with a good balance of fairness and firmness br br almost all the episodes are are involving and portrayed with intelligence reflecting on moral dilemmas as well as the friction between military interests and civilian beliefs often shown through arguments between o'neill and jackson guest characters are solidly depicted and story arcs are handled in a manner that doesn't bore viewers sg1 also excels in humour from o'neill s wisecracks to episodes that are just wacky and odd sg1 has everything from action to drama to romance to suspense to the heartbreaking scenes of death it isn't just an excellent sci-fi show but is an excellent show overall 
sure this movie is sappy and sweet and full of clich s but it's entertaining and that's what i watch movies for to be entertained natasha henstridge is stunning even with the short hair her smile is radiant and her beauty can't be disguised as for michael vartan i'm sure the women love him the two of them seemed to really like eacb other in this film i don't understand the comments that there was no chemistry between them i guess we see what we want to see br br olivia d'abo and michael rigoli were fun to watch even if d'abo s british accent did creep into her supposed bronx speech to tell you the truth i hadn't really noticed it until i read these comments but i went back to the dvd and now her dialogue sounds more british than american to me but she was ideal for her role with that one exception br br it's a story of two nice people who are getting married to significant others but who find their soul mates in one another it may be an unlikely story but who says movies are all supposed to play like documentaries it is no more unrealistic than any of the dramas that are screened every hour on the tube that's why we watch them to escape from the humdrum of daily living for a short time and enter the world of the characters on the screen i thought these actors did a good job of it but hey i'm a sentimental guy who tears up easily don't get me wrong though it has to be a sentimental scene and this movie had plenty of those br br i give it 9 10 only because i'm saving my 10 10 for that yet unseen super magnificent movie that i know will come along some day if you see it advertised as coming up on the movie channel or lifetime movies or whatever make a note to watch it i think you'll like it 
a beautiful postcard of new york the thing i enjoyed most was being able to watch this with my whole family and not cringe waiting for a stupid toilet humor joke to appear it never did my teenagers liked it too my son for natasha henstridge and my daughter for michael vartan my wife and i commented that we could not remember the last time we could sit with the kids and all enjoy something this film told a story that felt comfortable but not old or done the ending came with a twist which we all liked too if you are not just a cynical person and have are willing to let a story unfold then this is for you as a guy it takes a lot to hold my interest when it comes to romantic movies and this one did i recommend it and we need more of these films to watch 
i have looked forward to seeing this since i first saw it listed in her work finally found it yesterday 2 13 02 on lifetime movie channel br br jim larson's comments about it being a sweet funny story of 2 people crossing paths were dead on writers probably shouldn't get a bonus everyone else sro for making the movie br br anybody who appreciates a romantic movie should see it br br natasha's screen presence is so warm and her smile so electric to say nothing of her beauty that anything she is in goes on my favorite list her tv and print interviews that i have seen are just as refreshing and well worth looking for br br god bless her her family and future endeavors br br this movie doesn't seem to available in dvd or video yet but i would be the first to buy it and i think others would too 
i caught this film at a test screening was very surprised to find a really sweet and fun story well acted natasha henstridge is the next julia roberts the male lead was awsome very funny film takes place in the best locations in new york made me want to go there i just saw you've got mail i thought it had to be you was a much better story fresher br br it was clean and great for whole family i think it will do well audience i saw it with loved it a definite recommend 
this is the first michael vartan movie i've seen-i haven't seen alias and i was curious to see if the guy can act he sure can and is likable in this movie natasha henstridge is of course gorgeous but she is usually in more physical and action roles so i found her very good and lovable in this different sweet role of a schoolteacher some of the negative comments i read are true the movie is full of clich s and the story doesn't ring true at all also even though every character in the movie remarks how good they look together i don't think there is screen chemistry there however i enjoyed this movie the locales are nice the characters are likable and goodlooking and the supporting actors are pretty good if you are expecting to see a great romance this is not it but if you want to see a pleasant innocent goodlooking movie with likable characters its very good 
i just can't understand the negative comments about this film yes it is a typical boy-meets girl romance but it is done with such flair and polish that the time just flies by henstridge talk about winning the gene-pool lottery is as magnetic and alluring as ever who says the golden age of cinema is dead and vartan holds his own br br there is simmering chemistry between the two leads the film is most alive when they share a scene lots it is done so well that you find yourself willing them to get together br br ignore the negative comments if you are feeling a bit blue watch this flick you will feel so much better if you are already happy then you will be euphoric br br ps i am 33 male from the uk and a hopeless romantic still searching for his princess 
this great movie has failed to register a higher rating than 5 why not it is a great portrayal of the life of christ without the ruthless sensationalism of the passion of the christ johnny cash did great things for god which amazingly are shunned and neglected in areas where they should matter most like our churches the film itself took less than a month to film as johnny felt the strong presence of god guiding him through it great credit to everyone involved in this overwhelmingly sincere movie which will always be cherished by its fans at least the billy graham crusade rated it highly enough to use it as a prime source of education for new christians thanks fox for producing it as walk the line proved that it was freakish that this man survived yet alone produced such an underrated masterpiece movies are not canonized through popular vote as this production proves in summary i believe that this film is one of the worlds great documentaries as it is forthright honestly portrayed and a great witness to the christian faith 
this is an entertaining look at the gospel as presented by johnny cash adorned in black of course who sings a lot and narrates a bit also if you like johnny cash this film is quite enjoyable also note the blonde depiction of jesus in this work just for fun try to think of five jewish men who have blonde hair anyway its a fun presentation of the greatest and most important story of all 
johnny and june carter cash financed this film which is a traditional rendering of the gospel stories the music is great you get a real feel of what the world of jesus looked like i've been there too and june gets into the part of mary magdalene with a passion cash's narration is good too br br but br br 1 the actor who played jesus was miscast 2 there is no edge to the story like cash puts in some of his faith based music 3 because it is uncompelling i doubt we'll see this ever widely distributed again br br i'd love to buy the cd br br tom paine texas usa 
there are few films or movies i consider favorites over the years the gospel road was one of them i watched this as a young teen and would like the opportunity to watch it again my favorite parts were the fact that br br 1 jesus was blond br br 2 the last supper was a huge meal br br 3 he liked playing with the children br br 4 his death was for all people and for all time br br the movie may not have been theologically sound or high quality acting but it touched my heart at that time besides i am a johnny cash fan and it was a brave venture if it ever comes out on dvd i will purchase it purely for sentimental reasons 
i wait for each new episode each re-run with anticipation the new look of sci-fi created by stargate sg-1 is a wonder that i hope will never end to combine the past with the future is a new twist that is fascinating to me season 9 should be a thrill in itself i wish that richard dean anderson would show up more often in the new season as i love his dry wit as much as his temper tantrums in his character as jack o'neill the other characters add their own uniqueness to the show that makes it a winner season after season you cancel this program in the next three years and you make a serious mistake also you need a bigger role for the asgard they are just too cool 
i went into this film thinking it would be a crappy b-rated movie i came out surprised and very amused eva was good but lake bell stole the show she had amazing comedic timing the jokes in this film were surprisingly original and really funny with one or two flat jokes in between the plot was enough to tie it all together a woman eva dies on her wedding day and comes back to haunt the woman that is going out with her was-to be husband its sounds far-fetched but it actually works quite well br br 7 10 overall its a worthwhile cinema watch if not get it on dvd when it comes out 
i took a flyer in renting this movie but i gotta say it was very very good on all fronts script cast director photography and high production values etc proves eva longoria parker is head and shoulders in rom com above bad actors such as kate hudson and jennifer aniston who mug and call it acting who'da thunk it br br parker and isla fisher are in a class by themselves in this regard and should try to hold out for projects as good as over her dead body lake bell is excellent too and this is the first time i have seen her and finally paul rudd gets to shine in a really good movie instead of lesser films br br a movie like this never gets its dues from close-minded males it's too bad as other imdb reviewers here have noted there is nothing lame about this gem no hack writing or acting br br and its depiction of contemporary l a and california in general makes every scene look bright beautiful clean and otherwise outstanding in every way never before has a movie made l a look so good ah what a little talent and a lot of caring can do for a movie br br i won't divulge the plot but as a long-time and hard-core atheist i was willing to suspend disbelief and buy into the supernatural theme in order to enjoy an excellent and light-hearted piece of entertainment it reminds me very much of the old topper movies which were also so enjoyable br br this movie exposes popular but otherwise hackneyed movies like ghost for the mediocre and overly sentimental crap fests they are we already know the public taste leans heavily toward the mediocre some of us save our praise for the truly worthy however br br if you have enjoyed other overlooked gems such as into the night with michelle pfeiffer jeff goldblum and clu gulager blind date with bruce willis and kim basinger american dreamer with jobeth williams chances are with robert downey jr christopher mcdonald and cybil sheppard making mr right with john malkovich etc you'll enjoy this br br a first-rate job all around even if it's kinda hard to believe a straight guy can pretend to be gay for more than five years but even that plot device doesn't detract from the movie's overall excellence 
ah i loved this movie i think it had it all it made me laugh out loud over a dozen of times yes i am a girl so i'm writing this from a girl's perspective i think it's a shame it only scored 5 2 in rating too many guys voting it was far above other romantic comedies just because i'm female i don't enjoy all chic flicks on the contrary i prefer other genres romantic comedies tend to be shallow and not as funny as they meant to be but like i said this movie had it all almost in my opinion great script good one-liners fine acting although eva longoria parker's character reminded very much of gabrielle from desperate housewives but so what it was awesome i will keep this film for rainy days days when i feel low and need a few laughs 
this had a good story it had a nice pace and all characters are developed cool br br i've watched a whole bunch of movies in the last two weeks and this had to be the best one i've seen in the two weeks br br jason bigg's character was the best though br br even though it was small it was cleverly crafted from the very beginning br br this may be a romantic comedy and i don't like most but the writing direction performing sound design overall in all capacity just was really thought out pretty cool br br this film scored pretty high out of all the movie's i've seen lately and the rest were big budget or better publicized br br good job in writing 
this is a great film br br i agreed to watch a chick flick and some how ended up with this i had never heard of it or anyone in it excpet mike from friends br br but it is great eva lake and paul give amazing performances the humour is consistently dry and witty br br paul rudd pretty much plays the mike character from friends which works great the other characters are stereotypes and the plot is formulaic i mean we are not talking apocalypse now here but the characters are likable the story is engaging the soundtrack production and direction all work well br br in all a great feel-good film that really deserves a lot more credit than it gets br br everyone has their own tastes but i really don't understand the one star reviews for this 
actually my vote is a 7 5 anyway the movie was good it has those funny parts that make it deserve to see it don't misunderstand me is not the funniest movie of the world and its not even original because its a idea that we have seen before in other movies but this one has its own taste a friend of mine told me that this was a film for boyfriends i think that not exactly but who cares also there is another movie that show us almost the same topic chris rock appears in it the name is down to earth men that one its a very funny movie see both if you want and i know that you will agree that mr rock won with his movie i would liked that the protagonist male character were given to ashton kutcher however the film is good 
i watched this on an 8 hour flight and presumably because of the pressure and the altitude i actually found it mildly entertaining emphasis on the mild br br the actual idea behind the film was brilliant a woman dies her fianc falls in love with someone else she decided to make sure they don't get together but eventually she lets them do it sadly the actual film wasn't as good ok there were a few laughs and the actors all worked well but from the beginning the plot was about as predictable as the destination of the flight i was on i think the whole gay-but not-gay friend part of the story could have been worked a lot better the talking parrot was a nice idea but to be honest it wasn't really very funny br br in summary the film was more interesting than staring at the seat in front of me but it was a close call 
i wasn't a fan of seeing this movie at all but when my gf called me and said she had a free advanced screening pass i tagged along only for the sake of seeing eva longoria and laughing at jason biggs antics br br overall it was actually better then i expected but not by much this was like a hybrid of how to lose a guy in 10 days and just like heaven a typical romantic comedy with its moments i guess the movie was quite short though around 85 min but it was enough to tell the whole story build some character development and have a decent happy ending the whole idea of a ghost haunting its former husband was a interesting plot to follow eva did a good job of keeping up the sarcasm and paul rudd and the rest of the supporting cast especially jason biggs kept the laughs coming at a smooth pace br br overall i liked the movie only because it had a good amount of laughs to keep me going otherwise i would have given this movie a lower rating hey its a chick flick and i'm reviewing this movie from a guy's persepctive alright it would be more of a fair fight if females reviewied this movie and gave there thoughts about it 
look it's eva longoria and paul rudd in a movie about a dead girlfriend haunting the new girlfriend it's gabrielle from desperate housewives and the guy who wore sex panther cologne in anchorman if you are expecting a golden globe nominated movie then you need to rethink how you look at movies however if you are willing to suspend reality for 90 minutes and want to watch a funny movie then you've come to the right place the characters are all funny they work together very well the real match up is paul rudd and lake bell he's as funny as he was on friends and she was funny and good looking all at the same time i went with my wife she enjoyed it and so did i 
over her dead body was a nice little movie it was decent and entertaining while still being pretty funny there were a few clich s but i found most stuff fresh at first i didn't think it was going to be good at all when it started out if you can get past the first 20 minutes though the movie starts getting more interesting this film wasn't burst out in laughter hilarious and wasn't oh my gosh wonderful it was just a movie that you can sit down and enjoy for how enjoyable it was i don't see how this movie was bad it's rating is just a bit too low i could've dealt with a 5 5 but a 4 8 also giving this movie a 1 is disgraceful it was pretty good and there was nothing horrible enough about it to give it a 1 which is what most people gave it 
i would have given this otherwise terrific series a full 10 vote if claudia black had not continued on in it her inclusion as the silly vela has brought the series down in my estimation to bring her in as a regular at the same time as including ben browder to replace rda was a mistake br br unfortunately we were just reeling from the loss of jack and really didn't need this great series turned into new episodes of farscape br br i was a great fan of the film stargate and when the series was first announced i had reservations that it could live up to the film but after watching the first episode i have to admit i was hooked i have always looked forward to new episodes with great anticipation 
in complete contrast to the opinions of the other review this film actually was surprisingly good i reluctantly went to see it and expected to be bored by clich s obvious jokes and overacting all of which the trailer had promised br br however after 5 minutes in i found myself genuinely laughing and enjoying the refreshing acting with only one toilet humour gag over her dead body manages to actually come up with realistically funny scenarios and without spoiling anything too much some of the moments involving animals are hilarious br br the staple ingredients of a good film are all there script director and actors and compared some other recent attempts at romantic comedy this film stands tall br br sure you aren't going to learn anything or have a spiritual awakening but if you go with an open mind you will more than likely have a good time 
once when i was in college and we had an international fair the russian section had a soviet-era poster saying ne boltay meaning don't gossip i translated it for the generation of tv watchers as don't be gladys kravitz in reference to the nosy neighbor on bewitched br br however when you see the result of gossip in the pvt snafu short rumors you see that it's not quite a laughing matter in this case the perpetually witless soldier overhears something about bombing and immediately assumes that the axis powers have attacked the united states so he tells it to someone who tells someone else who tells someone else and it continues as in the russians are coming the russians are coming the story gets blown more and more out of proportion each time so that when it gets back to snafu well you know what i mean yes it's mostly wwii propaganda complete with a derogatory term for the japanese but i have to say that the pvt snafu shorts were actually quite funny of course since they had dr seuss writing and mel blanc providing the voices it's no surprise that these came out rather cool worth seeing 
friz freleng's rumours is an excellent private snafu cartoon that warns against spreading panic-inducing rumours during wartime produced as were all the snafu shorts to be shown to military audiences as entertaining instructional films rumours is extremely imaginative and crams tons of ideas into its very brief lifespan when snafu starts a rumour about a bombing it escalates into an eventual rumour that america has lost the war this is illustrated brilliantly by way of a long rubbery piece of baloney and several strange fictional creatures who come back to haunt snafu with ever more terrible news about his country's military rumours is inventive fast paced and funny all of which help to overshadow the rather laboured don't badmouth the military message it stands up as one of the best of the private snafu shorts 
rumors is a memorable entry in the wartime series of instructional cartoons starring private snafu the films were aimed at servicemen and were directed animated and scored by some of the top talent from warner bros termite terrace including friz freleng chuck jones and carl stalling the invaluable mel blanc supplied the voice for snafu and the stories and rhyming narration for many of the films was supplied by theodor geisel i e dr seuss the idea was to convey basic concepts with humor and vivid imagery using the character of snafu as a perfect negative example he was the dope the little twerp who would do everything you're not supposed to do according to chuck jones the scripts had to be approved by pentagon officials but army brass also permitted the animators an unusual amount of freedom concerning language and bawdy jokes certainly more than theatrical censorship of the time would allow all for the greater good of course br br as the title would indicate this cartoon is an illustration of the damaging power of rumors the setting is an army camp private snafu sits next to another soldier in the latrine something you won't see in any other hollywood films of the era and their casual conversation starts the ball rolling we observe as an offhand remark about a bombing is misinterpreted then exaggerated then turned into an increasingly frightening rumor that sweeps the camp the imagery is indeed vivid the brain of one anxious soldier is depicted as a percolating pot while the fevered speech of another is rendered as steamy hot air i e balloon juice a soldier shoots his mouth off cannon-style and before you know it actual baloney is flying in every direction winged baloney at that panicked soldiers tell each other that the brooklyn bridge has been pulverized coney island wiped out enemy troops have landed on the white house lawn and the japanese are in california the visuals become ever more surreal and nightmarish until at last the camp is quarantined for rumor-itis and private snafu has been locked up in a padded cell br br this is a highly effective piece of work the filmmakers dramatized their theme with wit and startling energy and the message is still a valid one in recent years we've seen that catastrophic events real or imagined can breed all kinds of wild rumors that spread more rapidly than ever thanks to communication advances because the technology has improved the private snafus of our time are able to broadcast their own balloon juice via e-mail cellphones and blogging consequently rumors is a rare example of a wartime educational film whose essential message doesn't feel at all dated in fact it may be more timely than ever 
this was another world war ii message to the soldiers and to the allies to be careful about spreading rumors these were called instructional cartoons because it was a mixture of serious messages along with a funny-looking main character called pvt snafu br br all of us have imaginations along with fears and what-have you and that's what happens here as pvt snafu incorrectly adds two and two to something he hears and comes up with five you can start panics and all kinds of disasters if you spread enough rumors and enough people believe them that includes losing confidence in your country and your cause as pointed out here in this cartoon a good way to lose a war is demoralize the enemy that's still being done today br br we lost the war declares one big baloney near the end of this cartoon amazing how some americans still haven't learned this cartoon may be 65 years old but it sure has relevance today as i write this there were two terrorist bombings in europe today and some people still think the war on terror is just a bumper sticker slogan amazing br br the writer the famous dr suess uses analogies of hot air balloon juice here to present the above message with theodore geisel his real name you know the rhymes will be clever br br nothing hilarious here but it wasn't meant to be you have to understand the climate of 1943 and the justified paranoia that was out there during world war ii people forget that war could have easily wound up with the other side winning it was a tense time 
though structured totally different from the book by tim krabb who wrote the original the vanishing spoorloos it does have the same overall feel except for that koolhoven's style is less business-like and more lyric the beginning is great the middle is fine but the sting is in the end a surprise emotional ending as you could read in several magazines there is some sex in the film but it is done all very beautifully never explicit but with lots of warmth and sometimes even humour it is a shame american films can't be as open an honoust as this one where dutch films tend to go just over the edge when it comes to this subject de grot stays always within the boundaries of good taste de grot tells an amazing story stretched over more than 30 years when you'll leave the cinema you'll be moved what can we ask more of a film anyway this film even gives more 
tim krabbe is the praised author of het gouden ei a novel that was put on the screen twice spoorloos and the vanishing one of the dutch writer's more recent works is de grot a psychological thriller about two totally different men egon and axel who meet at a youth camp and surprising enough become friends for dear life egon is a quiet somewhat dull person who spends his time studying and writing geography books axel on the other hand is a charismatic party-animal a heavy drinking criminal whose everyday's concern is to get a woman into his bedroom from the moment they meet axel has a strong influence on egon while the latter envies him because he has a good life without really doing anything such as reading thick books like egon ultimately egon is even dragged by egon into illegal practices himself which leads to a fatal drug transport in a distant asian country br br after having read the book last year i was surprised the critics were quite positive about it in my opinion the book suffers especially from the complex structure while krabbe presents the story as an absorbing portrait of an uncommon relationship between two people the plot becomes more of a puzzle the many episodes are not presented chronologically so that two successive scenes are seldom in the same episode because of this the story feels surprisingly remote you often need to know a character's background to really care for him or her another complaint was the fact that the main characters egon and axel are a little stereotypical egon is the dull intellectual while axel is his exact opposite in real life such one-dimensional people rarely exist in books and films they always seem to be there taking away a lot of credibility br br despite all this the film was a pleasant surprise being much better than the book the adaptation excels in its beautiful cinematography humour and acting fedja van huet egon is one of the few dutch actors who can make you forget he is acting which is in my opinion the highest an actor can achieve the drawbacks of the film however are the same as the book's mainly because the characters are one-dimensional they are so predictable that it becomes annoying guess who wrote the script indeed krabbe himself it is obvious that this talented director that's what the movie makes clear anyway is hampered by a deficient screenplay perhaps koolhoven should just have chosen a better book br br 7 10 
de grot is a terrific dutch thriller based on the book written by tim krabb another of his books het gouden ei was made into the great dutch mystery thriller called spoorloos the vanishing in 1988 this one is not as good as that thriller although much better than the american remake also called the vanishing but there are times it comes close br br especially the opening moments are terrific we see a man later we learn his name is egon wagter fedja van hu t coming from a plane in thailand when he picks up his bags it is pretty clear that he is smuggling something across the border these scenes are perfectly directed photographed and acted a kind of suspense is created that you would normally not have in an opening scene like this later we see how egon makes his deal in thailand with a woman both stating that they have never done anything like this br br from this point the movie is constantly flashback and flash-forward we see how egon still as a child here played by erik van der horst befriends a guy named axel as a kid played by benja bruijning we learn how they grew up as friends sort of and how axel as an adult played by marcel hensema became a criminal egon in the meanwhile goes to college and settles with a woman around this time he sometimes meets axel but does not really want anything to do with him br br the movie is chronological in a way it shows egon and axel as kids than as students young adults and in their mid-thirties but from time to time like i said the movie goes back to when they were kids and jumps forward again every time we see them as kids it explains something that happens when they are adults br br minor spoilers herein br br the title means the cave and it is the cave that gives the movie its happy ending although it is in fact not that happy like the beginning the ending is terrific the middle part of the movie is entertaining and in a way it distracts our attention of the first scenes only to come back at that point in the end it is the editing that gives the movie its happy ending although we can say the dramatic ending is happy in a way as well

de grot is a very good film the great plot comes from the novel by tim krabb who also adapted this story for the screen some really top-class acting not only by van hu t but especially by marcel hensema who mostly did tv-work prior to his performance of axel van de graaf the film seems to kick of as a thriller and sets an excellent mood then we start to learn about egon wagter and axel van de graaf and the story is revealed bit by bit in a very compelling flash-back structure which adds to the more romantic aspect and the character-driven drama of the movie in the end this all culminates into an emotional ending that will grab audiences by their throats make sure you know as little as possible about the plot when you are going to see this movie a must-see especially if you liked spoorloos the vanishing's original screen adaptation 
i started watching the show from the first season and at the beginning i was pretty skeptical about it original movie was kind of childish and i was just looking for some sci-fi show while waiting for the bsg new season br br but after few episodes i became a fan i've loved the characters the not-so stupid-as you-think he-is jack o'neill the not-only smart samantha carter the glorious teal'c women and kids favorite and brilliant dr daniel jackson br br of course stories sometimes not serious sometimes even ridiculous but mostly it's not about technology or space fighting it's about helping your friend even risking your life for him it's about we don't leave anybody behind struggling to the end when all hope is lost about the free will and all good qualities that makes a human human br br and now it's breaking a record going 10th season and still doing good
