bromwell high is a cartoon comedy it ran at the same time as some other programs about school life such as teachers my 35 years in the teaching profession lead me to believe that bromwell high's satire is much closer to reality than is teachers the scramble to survive financially the insightful students who can see right through their pathetic teachers pomp the pettiness of the whole situation all remind me of the schools i knew and their students when i saw the episode in which a student repeatedly tried to burn down the school i immediately recalled at high a classic line inspector i'm here to sack one of your teachers student welcome to bromwell high i expect that many adults of my age think that bromwell high is far fetched what a pity that it isn't 
homelessness or houselessness as george carlin stated has been an issue for years but never a plan to help those on the street that were once considered human who did everything from going to school work or vote for the matter most people think of the homeless as just a lost cause while worrying about things such as racism the war on iraq pressuring kids to succeed technology the elections inflation or worrying if they'll be next to end up on the streets br br but what if you were given a bet to live on the streets for a month without the luxuries you once had from a home the entertainment sets a bathroom pictures on the wall a computer and everything you once treasure to see what it's like to be homeless that is goddard bolt's lesson br br mel brooks who directs who stars as bolt plays a rich man who has everything in the world until deciding to make a bet with a sissy rival jeffery tambor to see if he can live in the streets for thirty days without the luxuries if bolt succeeds he can do what he wants with a future project of making more buildings the bet's on where bolt is thrown on the street with a bracelet on his leg to monitor his every move where he can't step off the sidewalk he's given the nickname pepto by a vagrant after it's written on his forehead where bolt meets other characters including a woman by the name of molly lesley ann warren an ex-dancer who got divorce before losing her home and her pals sailor howard morris and fumes teddy wilson who are already used to the streets they're survivors bolt isn't he's not used to reaching mutual agreements like he once did when being rich where it's fight or flight kill or be killed br br while the love connection between molly and bolt wasn't necessary to plot i found life stinks to be one of mel brooks observant films where prior to being a comedy it shows a tender side compared to his slapstick work such as blazing saddles young frankenstein or spaceballs for the matter to show what it's like having something valuable before losing it the next day or on the other hand making a stupid bet like all rich people do when they don't know what to do with their money maybe they should give it to the homeless instead of using it like monopoly money br br or maybe this film will inspire you to help others 
brilliant over-acting by lesley ann warren best dramatic hobo lady i have ever seen and love scenes in clothes warehouse are second to none the corn on face is a classic as good as anything in blazing saddles the take on lawyers is also superb after being accused of being a turncoat selling out his boss and being dishonest the lawyer of pepto bolt shrugs indifferently i'm a lawyer he says three funny words jeffrey tambor a favorite from the later larry sanders show is fantastic here too as a mad millionaire who wants to crush the ghetto his character is more malevolent than usual the hospital scene and the scene where the homeless invade a demolition site are all-time classics look for the legs scene and the two big diggers fighting one bleeds this movie gets better each time i see it which is quite often 
this is easily the most underrated film inn the brooks cannon sure its flawed it does not give a realistic view of homelessness unlike say how citizen kane gave a realistic view of lounge singers or titanic gave a realistic view of italians you idiots many of the jokes fall flat but still this film is very lovable in a way many comedies are not and to pull that off in a story about some of the most traditionally reviled members of society is truly impressive its not the fisher king but its not crap either my only complaint is that brooks should have cast someone else in the lead i love mel as a director and writer not so much as a lead 
this is not the typical mel brooks film it was much less slapstick than most of his movies and actually had a plot that was followable leslie ann warren made the movie she is such a fantastic under-rated actress there were some moments that could have been fleshed out a bit more and some scenes that could probably have been cut to make the room to do so but all in all this is worth the price to rent and see it the acting was good overall brooks himself did a good job without his characteristic speaking to directly to the audience again warren was the best actor in the movie but fume and sailor both played their parts well 
this isn't the comedic robin williams nor is it the quirky insane robin williams of recent thriller fame this is a hybrid of the classic drama without over-dramatization mixed with robin's new love of the thriller but this isn't a thriller per se this is more a mystery suspense vehicle through which williams attempts to locate a sick boy and his keeper br br also starring sandra oh and rory culkin this suspense drama plays pretty much like a news report until william's character gets close to achieving his goal br br i must say that i was highly entertained though this movie fails to teach guide inspect or amuse it felt more like i was watching a guy williams as he was actually performing the actions from a third person perspective in other words it felt real and i was able to subscribe to the premise of the story br br all in all it's worth a watch though it's definitely not friday saturday night fare br br it rates a 7 7 10 from br br the fiend 
yes its an art to successfully make a slow paced thriller br br the story unfolds in nice volumes while you don't even notice it happening br br fine performance by robin williams the sexuality angles in the film can seem unnecessary and can probably affect how much you enjoy the film however the core plot is very engaging the movie doesn't rush onto you and still grips you enough to keep you wondering the direction is good use of lights to achieve desired affects of suspense and unexpectedness is good br br very nice 1 time watch if you are looking to lay back and hear a thrilling short story 
in this critically acclaimed psychological thriller based on true events gabriel robin williams a celebrated writer and late-night talk show host becomes captivated by the harrowing story of a young listener and his adoptive mother toni collette when troubling questions arise about this boy's story however gabriel finds himself drawn into a widening mystery that hides a deadly secret according to film's official synopsis br br you really should stop reading these comments and watch the film now br br the how did he lose his leg ending with ms collette planning her new life should be chopped off and sent to deleted scenes land it's overkill the true nature of her physical and mental ailments should be obvious by the time mr williams returns to new york possibly her blindness could be in question but a revelation could have be made certain in either the highway or video tape scenes the film would benefit from a re-editing how about a director's cut br br williams and bobby cannavale as jess don't seem initially believable as a couple a scene or two establishing their relationship might have helped set the stage otherwise the cast is exemplary williams offers an exceptionally strong characterization and not a gay impersonation sandra oh as anna joe morton as ashe and rory culkin pete logand are all perfect br br best of all collette's donna belongs in the creepy hall of fame ms oh is correct in saying collette might be you know like that guy from psycho there have been several years when organizations giving acting awards seemed to reach for women due to a slighter dispersion of roles certainly they could have noticed collette with some award consideration she is that good and director patrick stettner definitely evokes hitchcock he even makes getting a sandwich from a vending machine suspenseful br br finally writers stettner armistead maupin and terry anderson deserve gratitude from flight attendants everywhere br br the night listener 1 21 06 patrick stettner robin williams toni collette sandra oh rory culkin 
the night listener 2006 1 2 robin williams toni collette bobby cannavale rory culkin joe morton sandra oh john cullum lisa emery becky ann baker dir patrick stettner br br hitchcockian suspenser gives williams a stand-out low-key performance br br what is it about celebrities and fans what is the near paranoia one associates with the other and why is it almost the norm br br in the latest derange fan scenario based on true events no less williams stars as a talk-radio personality named gabriel no one who reads stories he's penned over the airwaves and has accumulated an interesting fan in the form of a young boy named pete logand culkin who has submitted a manuscript about the travails of his troubled youth to no one's editor ashe morton who gives it to no one to read for himself br br no one is naturally disturbed but ultimately intrigued about the nightmarish existence of pete being abducted and sexually abused for years until he was finally rescued by a nurse named donna collette giving an excellent performance who has adopted the boy but her correspondence with no one reveals that pete is dying from aids naturally no one wants to meet the fans but is suddenly in doubt to their possibly devious ulterior motives when the seed is planted by his estranged lover jess cannavale whose sudden departure from their new york city apartment has no one in an emotional tailspin that has only now grown into a tempest in a teacup when he decides to do some investigating into donna and pete's backgrounds discovering some truths that he didn't anticipate br br written by armistead maupin who co-wrote the screenplay with his former lover terry anderson and the film's novice director stettner and based on a true story about a fan's hoax found out has some hitchcockian moments that run on full tilt like any good old fashioned pot-boiler does it helps that williams gives a stand-out low-key performance as the conflicted good-hearted personality who genuinely wants to believe that his number one fan is in fact real and does love him the one thing that has escaped his own reality and has some unsettling dreadful moments with the creepy collette whose one physical trait i will leave unmentioned but underlines the desperation of her character that can rattle you to the core br br however the film runs out of gas and eventually becomes a bit repetitive and predictable despite a finely directed piece of hoodwink and mystery by stettner it pays to listen to your own inner voice be careful of what you hope for 
you know robin williams god bless him is constantly shooting himself in the foot lately with all these dumb comedies he has done this decade with perhaps the exception of death to smoochy which bombed when it came out but is now a cult classic the dramas he has made lately have been fantastic especially insomnia and one hour photo the night listener despite mediocre reviews and a quick dvd release is among his best work period br br this is a very chilling story even though it doesn't include a serial killer or anyone that physically dangerous for that matter the concept of the film is based on an actual case of fraud that still has yet to be officially confirmed in high school i read an autobiography by a child named anthony godby johnson who suffered horrific abuse and eventually contracted aids as a result i was moved by the story until i read reports online that johnson may not actually exist when i saw this movie the confused feelings that robin williams so brilliantly portrayed resurfaced in my mind br br toni collette probably gives her best dramatic performance too as the ultimately sociopathic caretaker her role was a far cry from those she had in movies like little miss sunshine there were even times she looked into the camera where i thought she was staring right at me it takes a good actress to play that sort of role and it's this understated yet well reviewed role that makes toni collette probably one of the best actresses of this generation not to have even been nominated for an academy award as of 2008 it's incredible that there is at least one woman in this world who is like this and it's scary too br br this is a good dark film that i highly recommend be prepared to be unsettled though because this movie leaves you with a strange feeling at the end
